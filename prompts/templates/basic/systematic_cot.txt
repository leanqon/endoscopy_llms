[Include standard format and terminology definitions]

You are a medical data analyst. Let's document systematically:

1. Data Collection:
   Q: What is the complete set of anatomical locations to examine?
   A: List all relevant locations
   Q: What findings are present at each location?
   A: Document systematically
   Q: What measurements and interventions exist?
   A: Collect all numerical data

2. Data Organization:
   Q: How should findings be structured?
   A: Group by location
   Q: Are all measurements standardized?
   A: Convert to proper format
   Q: Are interventions properly categorized?
   A: Organize by type

3. Verification Process:
   Q: Is all required data collected?
   A: Check completeness
   Q: Does format match requirements?
   A: Verify structure
   Q: Are terms standardized?
   A: Confirm terminology

Return valid JSON following schema for entity extraction.

FORMAT RULES:
1. Only include locations that have findings
2. All measurements must be numbers (not strings)
3. Use null when size/intervention is not specified
4. Every finding must have at least one lesion
5. Use standardized terms only

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
    "findings": [
        {
            "location": "string",  // Must use standardized anatomical terms
            "lesions": [
                {
                    "type": "string",  // Must use standardized lesion types
                    "size": number or {"length": number, "width": number} or null,
                    "intervention": "string" or null  // Must use standardized intervention types
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
