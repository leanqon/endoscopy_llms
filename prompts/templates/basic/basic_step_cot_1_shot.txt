[Include standard format and terminology definitions]

You are a medical data annotator. Let's analyze this endoscopic report:

1. Location Identification:
   Q: What locations are described in the report?
   A: List only anatomical locations with findings
   Q: Are we using standardized location terms?
   A: Verify against approved terminology

2. Finding Documentation:
   Q: For each location, what findings are present?
   A: List using standardized lesion types
   Q: Are measurements provided?
   A: Convert to numeric format
   Q: Were interventions performed?
   A: Document using standard terms

3. Completeness Check:
   Q: Have we captured all findings?
   A: Review report for missed items
   Q: Are all measurements in numeric format?
   A: Verify data formatting
   Q: Are all interventions documented?
   A: Check intervention records

Return valid JSON following schema for entity extraction.

FORMAT RULES:
1. Only include locations that have findings
2. All measurements must be numbers (not strings)
3. Use null when size/intervention is not specified
4. Every finding must have at least one lesion
5. Use standardized terms only

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
    "findings": [
        {
            "location": "string",  // Must use standardized anatomical terms
            "lesions": [
                {
                    "type": "string",  // Must use standardized lesion types
                    "size": number or {"length": number, "width": number} or null,
                    "intervention": "string" or null  // Must use standardized intervention types
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}

STANDARDIZED TERMS:
Anatomical Locations:
Upper GI:
- esophagus_upper, esophagus_middle, esophagus_lower
- gastric_cardia, gastric_fundus, gastric_body, gastric_angle, gastric_antrum, gastric_pylorus
- duodenal_bulb, duodenal_descending

Lower GI:
- terminal_ileum
- ileocecal_valve, appendiceal_orifice
- ascending_colon, transverse_colon, descending_colon
- sigmoid_colon, rectum

Lesion Types:
- polyp, ulcer, erosion, mass
- mucosal_defect, mucosal_patch
- diverticulum, lymphoid_hyperplasia

Intervention Types:
- biopsy_forceps, emr, esd, ster
- polypectomy, apc, injection, clipping
- hemostasis, submucosal_dissection

## Example 1:
Gender: Male
Age: 74
Endoscopic Findings: Esophagus: No abnormalities. Cardia: Z-line clear, normal position, mucosa normal color and smooth. Fundus: Smooth mucosa, clear mucus, small amount. Body: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly red. Angle: Normal morphology, smooth mucosa, curvature present. Antrum: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly white, scattered punctate and patchy erosions in antrum. Pylorus: Round, opens and closes well. Duodenum: Bulb shows mucosal congestion, descending portion shows multiple shallow ulcers covered with yellow-black coating.

### Reasoning:
1. Location Identification:
   Q: What locations are described in the report?
   A: The report describes: esophagus, gastric cardia, gastric fundus, gastric body, gastric angle, gastric antrum, gastric pylorus, duodenal bulb, and duodenal descending portion.

   Q: Are we using standardized location terms?
   A: After verification, only gastric_antrum and duodenal_descending have findings that need to be documented.

2. Finding Documentation:
   Q: For each location, what findings are present?
   A: In gastric_antrum: scattered erosions. In duodenal_descending: multiple ulcers.

   Q: Are measurements provided?
   A: No measurements are provided for these findings.

   Q: Were interventions performed?
   A: No interventions are described in the report.

3. Completeness Check:
   Q: Have we captured all findings?
   A: Yes, all findings have been captured.

   Q: Are all measurements in numeric format?
   A: No measurements were provided, so they will be set to null.

   Q: Are all interventions documented?
   A: No interventions were mentioned, so they will be set to null.

### Output:

    "findings": [
        {
            "location": "gastric_antrum",
            "lesions": [

                    "intervention": null
                }
