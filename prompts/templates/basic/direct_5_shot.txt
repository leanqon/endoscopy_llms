[Include standard format and terminology definitions]

You are a medical data annotator. Extract findings from this endoscopic report. Follow the format rules exactly and use only standardized terms.

Return valid JSON following schema for entity extraction.

FORMAT RULES:
1. Only include locations that have findings
2. All measurements must be numbers (not strings)
3. Use null when size/intervention is not specified
4. Every finding must have at least one lesion
5. Use standardized terms only

Here is five examples of how to extract information from an endoscopic report:

Example 1:
Gender: Male
Age: 74
Endoscopic Findings: Esophagus: No abnormalities. Cardia: Z-line clear, normal position, mucosa normal color and smooth. Fundus: Smooth mucosa, clear mucus, small amount. Body: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly red. Angle: Normal morphology, smooth mucosa, curvature present. Antrum: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly white, scattered punctate and patchy erosions in antrum. Pylorus: Round, opens and closes well. Duodenum: Bulb shows mucosal congestion, descending portion shows multiple shallow ulcers covered with yellow-black coating.
Endoscopic Diagnosis: Duodenal bulbitis, multiple descending duodenal ulcers, chronic non-atrophic gastritis with erosions.
