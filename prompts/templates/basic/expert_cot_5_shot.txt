2. Lesion Characterization:
   Q: For each finding, what are the key characteristics?
   A: The antral erosions are described as scattered, punctate, and patchy. The duodenal ulcers are described as multiple, shallow, and covered with yellow-black coating.

   Q: What are the exact measurements?

### Reasoning:
1. Anatomical Examination:
   Q: As I examine each segment, what abnormalities do I observe?

   Q: Are the anatomical landmarks clearly identified?
   A: Yes, the locations are clearly identified, although I need to translate "beyond 30cm" to esophagus_middle.

2. Lesion Characterization:
   Q: For each finding, what are the key characteristics?
   A: The esophageal varices have red signs (indicating high-risk features). The antral findings include erosions and a 0.3cm ulcer. The duodenal polyp is 0.5cm and hyperplastic.

   Q: What are the exact measurements?
   A: Measurements are provided for the ulcer (0.3cm) and polyp (0.5cm), but not for the varices or erosions.

   Q: What interventions were necessary?
   A: Sclerotherapy was performed on the esophageal varices with 6ml polidocanol.

3. Professional Documentation:
   Q: Have I documented all clinically relevant findings?
   A: Yes, all clinically relevant findings have been documented.
