[Include standard format and terminology definitions]

You are a medical data analyst. Let's follow clinical protocol:

1. Standard Documentation:
   Q: Following protocol, what locations require examination?
   A: List per guidelines
   Q: What findings must be documented?
   A: Note per standards
   Q: What measurements are required?
   A: Record per protocol

2. Protocol Compliance:
   Q: Are findings documented using standard terminology?
   A: Verify approved terms
   Q: Are measurements in required format?
   A: Check standard units
   Q: Are interventions properly coded?
   A: Confirm standard codes

3. Quality Assurance:
   Q: Does documentation meet all requirements?
   A: Review standards
   Q: Are all mandatory fields complete?
   A: Check completeness
   Q: Is format compliant?
   A: Verify structure

Return valid JSON following schema for entity extraction.

FORMAT RULES:
1. Only include locations that have findings
2. All measurements must be numbers (not strings)
3. Use null when size/intervention is not specified
4. Every finding must have at least one lesion
5. Use standardized terms only

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
    "findings": [
        {
            "location": "string",  // Must use standardized anatomical terms
            "lesions": [
                {
                    "type": "string",  // Must use standardized lesion types
                    "size": number or {"length": number, "width": number} or null,
                    "intervention": "string" or null  // Must use standardized intervention types
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}

STANDARDIZED TERMS:
Anatomical Locations:
Upper GI:
- esophagus_upper, esophagus_middle, esophagus_lower
- gastric_cardia, gastric_fundus, gastric_body, gastric_angle, gastric_antrum, gastric_pylorus
- duodenal_bulb, duodenal_descending

Lower GI:
- terminal_ileum
- ileocecal_valve, appendiceal_orifice
- ascending_colon, transverse_colon, descending_colon
- sigmoid_colon, rectum

Lesion Types:
- polyp, ulcer, erosion, mass
- mucosal_defect, mucosal_patch
- diverticulum, lymphoid_hyperplasia

Intervention Types:
- biopsy_forceps, emr, esd, ster
- polypectomy, apc, injection, clipping
- hemostasis, submucosal_dissection

## Example 1:
Gender: Male
Age: 74
Endoscopic Findings: Esophagus: No abnormalities. Cardia: Z-line clear, normal position, mucosa normal color and smooth. Fundus: Smooth mucosa, clear mucus, small amount. Body: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly red. Angle: Normal morphology, smooth mucosa, curvature present. Antrum: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly white, scattered punctate and patchy erosions in antrum. Pylorus: Round, opens and closes well. Duodenum: Bulb shows mucosal congestion, descending portion shows multiple shallow ulcers covered with yellow-black coating.

### Reasoning:
1. Standard Documentation:
   Q: Following protocol, what locations require examination?
   A: Standard protocol requires examination of esophagus, stomach (cardia, fundus, body, angle, antrum, pylorus), and duodenum (bulb, descending portion). All these locations were examined.

   Q: What findings must be documented?
   A: Any mucosal abnormalities, lesions, or structural changes. In this case, erosions in the gastric antrum and ulcers in the duodenal descending portion must be documented.

   Q: What measurements are required?
   A: Size measurements for all discrete lesions, but none were provided in this report.

2. Protocol Compliance:
   Q: Are findings documented using standard terminology?
   A: The findings can be mapped to standard terminology: "erosion" and "ulcer".

   Q: Are measurements in required format?
   A: No measurements were provided, which deviates from best practice.

   Q: Are interventions properly coded?
   A: No interventions were performed to code.

3. Quality Assurance:
   Q: Does documentation meet all requirements?
   A: The documentation meets basic requirements but lacks quantitative information.

   Q: Are all mandatory fields complete?
   A: Yes, all required fields can be completed even with null values for missing information.

   Q: Is format compliant?
   A: Yes, the output will follow the required JSON format.

### Output:

    "findings": [
        {
            "location": "gastric_antrum",
            "lesions": [
                {
                    "type": "erosion",
                    "size": null,
                    "intervention": null
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "location": "duodenal_descending",
            "lesions": [
                {
                    "type": "ulcer",
                    "size": null,
                    "intervention": null
