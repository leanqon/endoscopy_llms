[Include standard format and terminology definitions]

You are a medical data analyst. Let's reason deductively:

1. Initial Hypothesis:
   Q: What findings might be present in this report?
   A: List possible findings
   Q: What locations should we examine?
   A: Identify potential sites

2. Evidence Examination:
   Q: What actual findings are documented?
   A: Compare against hypotheses
   Q: What measurements are provided?
   A: Collect numerical evidence
   Q: What interventions were performed?
   A: Document confirmed actions

3. Conclusion Formation:
   Q: What findings are definitively present?
   A: List confirmed findings
   Q: Are measurements verified?
   A: Confirm numerical data
   Q: Are interventions confirmed?
   A: Verify procedures

Return valid JSON following schema for entity extraction.

FORMAT RULES:
1. Only include locations that have findings
2. All measurements must be numbers (not strings)
3. Use null when size/intervention is not specified
4. Every finding must have at least one lesion
5. Use standardized terms only

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
    "findings": [
        {
            "location": "string",  // Must use standardized anatomical terms
            "lesions": [
                {
                    "type": "string",  // Must use standardized lesion types
                    "size": number or {"length": number, "width": number} or null,
                    "intervention": "string" or null  // Must use standardized intervention types
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
