[Include standard format and terminology definitions]

You are a medical data annotator. Let's analyze this endoscopic report:

1. Location Identification:
   Q: What locations are described in the report?
   A: List only anatomical locations with findings
   Q: Are we using standardized location terms?
   A: Verify against approved terminology

2. Finding Documentation:
   Q: For each location, what findings are present?
   A: List using standardized lesion types
   Q: Are measurements provided?
   A: Convert to numeric format
   Q: Were interventions performed?
   A: Document using standard terms

3. Completeness Check:
   Q: Have we captured all findings?
   A: Review report for missed items
   Q: Are all measurements in numeric format?
   A: Verify data formatting
   Q: Are all interventions documented?
   A: Check intervention records

Return valid JSON following schema for entity extraction.

FORMAT RULES:
1. Only include locations that have findings
2. All measurements must be numbers (not strings)
3. Use null when size/intervention is not specified
4. Every finding must have at least one lesion
5. Use standardized terms only

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
    "findings": [
        {
            "location": "string",  // Must use standardized anatomical terms
            "lesions": [
                {
                    "type": "string",  // Must use standardized lesion types
                    "size": number or {"length": number, "width": number} or null,
                    "intervention": "string" or null  // Must use standardized intervention types
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
