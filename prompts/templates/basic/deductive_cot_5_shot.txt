FORMAT RULES:
1. Only include locations that have findings
2. All measurements must be numbers (not strings)
3. Use null when size/intervention is not specified
4. Every finding must have at least one lesion
5. Use standardized terms only

## Example 1:
Gender: Male
Age: 74
Endoscopic Findings: Esophagus: No abnormalities. Cardia: Z-line clear, normal position, mucosa normal color and smooth. Fundus: Smooth mucosa, clear mucus, small amount. Body: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly red. Angle: Normal morphology, smooth mucosa, curvature present. Antrum: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly white, scattered punctate and patchy erosions in antrum. Pylorus: Round, opens and closes well. Duodenum: Bulb shows mucosal congestion, descending portion shows multiple shallow ulcers covered with yellow-black coating.

### Reasoning:
1. Initial Hypothesis:
   Q: What findings might be present in this report?
   A: Based on the endoscopic diagnosis, I would expect to find evidence of gastritis with erosions and duodenal ulcers.

   Q: What locations should we examine?
   A: I should examine the entire stomach (particularly the antrum) and duodenum.

2. Evidence Examination:
   Q: What actual findings are documented?
   A: The evidence shows scattered erosions in the gastric antrum and multiple shallow ulcers in the duodenal descending portion.

   Q: What measurements are provided?
   A: No specific measurements are provided for any lesions.

   Q: What interventions were performed?
   A: No interventions are mentioned in the report.

3. Conclusion Formation:
   Q: What findings are definitively present?
   A: Based on the evidence, there are erosions in the gastric antrum and ulcers in the duodenal descending portion.

   Q: Are measurements verified?
   A: No measurements were provided, so size fields will be null.

   Q: Are interventions confirmed?
   A: No interventions were mentioned, so intervention fields will be null.

   A: The evidence shows polyps in the ascending colon, transverse colon, and sigmoid colon, and a mass in the descending colon.

   Q: What measurements are provided?
   A: Measurements are provided for all lesions: 0.8cm polyp (ascending), 0.6-0.7cm polyps (transverse), 1.5×1.0cm mass (descending), and 0.3-0.5cm polyps (sigmoid).

   Q: What interventions were performed?
   A: EMR was performed for polyps in ascending and transverse colon, and forceps removal for sigmoid polyps.

3. Conclusion Formation:
   Q: What findings are definitively present?
   A: Based on the evidence, there are polyps in the ascending colon, transverse colon, and sigmoid colon, and a mass in the descending colon.

   Q: Are measurements verified?
   A: Yes, measurements are provided for all lesions and need to be formatted appropriately.

   Q: Are interventions confirmed?
   A: Yes, EMR and forceps removal are confirmed interventions that map to standardized terms.

## Example 3:
Gender: Male
Age: 34
Endoscopic Findings: Esophagus: two varices beyond 30cm with red signs, sclerotherapy performed (6ml polidocanol). Stomach: mosaic pattern, antral erosions, 0.3cm ulcer. Duodenum: 0.5cm hyperplastic polyp in descending part.

### Reasoning:
1. Initial Hypothesis:
   Q: What findings might be present in this report?
   A: Based on the patient's age and the mention of varices, I might expect to find evidence of portal hypertension, possibly with associated lesions in the upper GI tract.

   Q: What locations should we examine?
   A: I should examine the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.

2. Evidence Examination:
   Q: What actual findings are documented?
   A: The evidence shows two varices in the esophagus (beyond 30cm, which corresponds to middle esophagus), erosions and a 0.3cm ulcer in the gastric antrum, and a 0.5cm polyp in the duodenal descending portion.

   Q: What measurements are provided?
   A: Measurements are provided for the ulcer (0.3cm) and polyp (0.5cm), but not for the varices.

   Q: What interventions were performed?
   A: Sclerotherapy was performed for the esophageal varices.

3. Conclusion Formation:
   Q: What findings are definitively present?
   A: Based on the evidence, there are varices in the middle esophagus, erosions and an ulcer in the gastric antrum, and a polyp in the duodenal descending portion.

   Q: Are measurements verified?
   A: Measurements are verified for the ulcer and polyp, but not provided for the varices.

   Q: Are interventions confirmed?
   A: Sclerotherapy for the esophageal varices is confirmed and maps to "injection" in our standardized terms.
