[Include standard format and terminology definitions]

You are a medical data analyst. Let's reason deductively:

1. Initial Hypothesis:
   Q: What findings might be present in this report?
   A: List possible findings
   Q: What locations should we examine?
   A: Identify potential sites

2. Evidence Examination:
   Q: What actual findings are documented?
   A: Compare against hypotheses
   Q: What measurements are provided?
   A: Collect numerical evidence
   Q: What interventions were performed?
   A: Document confirmed actions

3. Conclusion Formation:
   Q: What findings are definitively present?
   A: List confirmed findings
   Q: Are measurements verified?
   A: Confirm numerical data
   Q: Are interventions confirmed?
   A: Verify procedures

Return valid JSON following schema for entity extraction.

FORMAT RULES:
1. Only include locations that have findings
2. All measurements must be numbers (not strings)
3. Use null when size/intervention is not specified
4. Every finding must have at least one lesion
5. Use standardized terms only

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
    "findings": [
        {
            "location": "string",  // Must use standardized anatomical terms
            "lesions": [
                {
                    "type": "string",  // Must use standardized lesion types
                    "size": number or {"length": number, "width": number} or null,
                    "intervention": "string" or null  // Must use standardized intervention types
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}

STANDARDIZED TERMS:
Anatomical Locations:
Upper GI:
- esophagus_upper, esophagus_middle, esophagus_lower
- gastric_cardia, gastric_fundus, gastric_body, gastric_angle, gastric_antrum, gastric_pylorus
- duodenal_bulb, duodenal_descending

Lower GI:
- terminal_ileum
- ileocecal_valve, appendiceal_orifice
- ascending_colon, transverse_colon, descending_colon
- sigmoid_colon, rectum

Lesion Types:
- polyp, ulcer, erosion, mass
- mucosal_defect, mucosal_patch
- diverticulum, lymphoid_hyperplasia

Intervention Types:
- biopsy_forceps, emr, esd, ster
- polypectomy, apc, injection, clipping
- hemostasis, submucosal_dissection

## Example 1:
Gender: Male
Age: 74
Endoscopic Findings: Esophagus: No abnormalities. Cardia: Z-line clear, normal position, mucosa normal color and smooth. Fundus: Smooth mucosa, clear mucus, small amount. Body: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly red. Angle: Normal morphology, smooth mucosa, curvature present. Antrum: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly white, scattered punctate and patchy erosions in antrum. Pylorus: Round, opens and closes well. Duodenum: Bulb shows mucosal congestion, descending portion shows multiple shallow ulcers covered with yellow-black coating.

### Reasoning:
1. Initial Hypothesis:
   Q: What findings might be present in this report?
   A: Based on the endoscopic diagnosis, I would expect to find evidence of gastritis with erosions and duodenal ulcers.

   Q: What locations should we examine?
   A: I should examine the entire stomach (particularly the antrum) and duodenum.

2. Evidence Examination:
   Q: What actual findings are documented?
   A: The evidence shows scattered erosions in the gastric antrum and multiple shallow ulcers in the duodenal descending portion.

   Q: What measurements are provided?
   A: No specific measurements are provided for any lesions.

   Q: What interventions were performed?
   A: No interventions are mentioned in the report.

3. Conclusion Formation:
   Q: What findings are definitively present?
   A: Based on the evidence, there are erosions in the gastric antrum and ulcers in the duodenal descending portion.

   Q: Are measurements verified?
   A: No measurements were provided, so size fields will be null.

   Q: Are interventions confirmed?
   A: No interventions were mentioned, so intervention fields will be null.

### Output:

    "findings": [
        {
            "location": "gastric_antrum",
