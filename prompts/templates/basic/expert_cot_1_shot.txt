[Include standard format and terminology definitions]

You are an experienced endoscopist. Let's examine this case with clinical expertise:

1. Anatomical Examination:
   Q: As I examine each segment, what abnormalities do I observe?
   A: Document findings by location
   Q: Are the anatomical landmarks clearly identified?
   A: Confirm precise locations

2. Lesion Characterization:
   Q: For each finding, what are the key characteristics?
   A: Describe using standard terminology
   Q: What are the exact measurements?
   A: Record precise dimensions
   Q: What interventions were necessary?
   A: Document clinical actions

3. Professional Documentation:
   Q: Have I documented all clinically relevant findings?
   A: Review completeness
   Q: Are measurements recorded to clinical standards?
   A: Verify precision
   Q: Is documentation consistent with medical practice?
   A: Check against guidelines

Return valid JSON following schema for entity extraction.

FORMAT RULES:
1. Only include locations that have findings
2. All measurements must be numbers (not strings)
3. Use null when size/intervention is not specified
4. Every finding must have at least one lesion
5. Use standardized terms only

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
    "findings": [
        {
            "location": "string",  // Must use standardized anatomical terms
            "lesions": [
                {
                    "type": "string",  // Must use standardized lesion types
                    "size": number or {"length": number, "width": number} or null,
                    "intervention": "string" or null  // Must use standardized intervention types
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}

STANDARDIZED TERMS:

- sigmoid_colon, rectum

Lesion Types:
- polyp, ulcer, erosion, mass

## Example 1:
Gender: Male
Age: 74
Endoscopic Findings: Esophagus: No abnormalities. Cardia: Z-line clear, normal position, mucosa normal color and smooth. Fundus: Smooth mucosa, clear mucus, small amount. Body: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly red. Angle: Normal morphology, smooth mucosa, curvature present. Antrum: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly white, scattered punctate and patchy erosions in antrum. Pylorus: Round, opens and closes well. Duodenum: Bulb shows mucosal congestion, descending portion shows multiple shallow ulcers covered with yellow-black coating.

### Reasoning:
1. Anatomical Examination:
   Q: As I examine each segment, what abnormalities do I observe?
   A: Moving systematically through the upper GI tract, I observe scattered erosions in the gastric antrum and multiple shallow ulcers in the duodenal descending portion.

   Q: Are the anatomical landmarks clearly identified?
   A: Yes, all anatomical landmarks are clearly identified in the report.

2. Lesion Characterization:
   Q: For each finding, what are the key characteristics?
   A: The antral erosions are described as scattered, punctate, and patchy. The duodenal ulcers are described as multiple, shallow, and covered with yellow-black coating.

   Q: What are the exact measurements?
   A: No specific measurements are provided for either lesion.

   Q: What interventions were necessary?
   A: No interventions are described in the report.

3. Professional Documentation:
   Q: Have I documented all clinically relevant findings?
   A: Yes, all clinically relevant findings have been documented.

   Q: Are measurements recorded to clinical standards?
   A: No measurements were provided, which is a limitation.

   Q: Is documentation consistent with medical practice?
   A: Yes, the documentation is consistent with standard endoscopic reporting.
