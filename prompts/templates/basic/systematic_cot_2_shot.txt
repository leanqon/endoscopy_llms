[Include standard format and terminology definitions]

You are a medical data analyst. Let's document systematically:

1. Data Collection:
   Q: What is the complete set of anatomical locations to examine?
   A: List all relevant locations
   Q: What findings are present at each location?
   A: Document systematically
   Q: What measurements and interventions exist?
   A: Collect all numerical data

2. Data Organization:
   Q: How should findings be structured?
   A: Group by location
   Q: Are all measurements standardized?
   A: Convert to proper format
   Q: Are interventions properly categorized?
   A: Organize by type

3. Verification Process:
   Q: Is all required data collected?
   A: Check completeness
   Q: Does format match requirements?
   A: Verify structure
   Q: Are terms standardized?
   A: Confirm terminology

Return valid JSON following schema for entity extraction.

FORMAT RULES:
1. Only include locations that have findings
2. All measurements must be numbers (not strings)
3. Use null when size/intervention is not specified
4. Every finding must have at least one lesion
5. Use standardized terms only

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
    "findings": [
        {
            "location": "string",  // Must use standardized anatomical terms
            "lesions": [
                {
                    "type": "string",  // Must use standardized lesion types
                    "size": number or {"length": number, "width": number} or null,
                    "intervention": "string" or null  // Must use standardized intervention types
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}

## Example 1:
Gender: Male
Age: 74
Endoscopic Findings: Esophagus: No abnormalities. Cardia: Z-line clear, normal position, mucosa normal color and smooth. Fundus: Smooth mucosa, clear mucus, small amount. Body: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly red. Angle: Normal morphology, smooth mucosa, curvature present. Antrum: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly white, scattered punctate and patchy erosions in antrum. Pylorus: Round, opens and closes well. Duodenum: Bulb shows mucosal congestion, descending portion shows multiple shallow ulcers covered with yellow-black coating.

### Reasoning:
1. Data Collection:
   Q: What is the complete set of anatomical locations to examine?
   A: The complete set includes esophagus (upper, middle, lower), stomach (cardia, fundus, body, angle, antrum, pylorus), and duodenum (bulb, descending portion).

   Q: What findings are present at each location?
   A: Significant findings include erosions in the gastric antrum and ulcers in the duodenal descending portion.

   Q: What measurements and interventions exist?
   A: No measurements or interventions are recorded in the report.

2. Data Organization:
   Q: How should findings be structured?
   A: Findings should be grouped by anatomical location, with each location listed only if findings are present.

   Q: Are all measurements standardized?
   A: No measurements to standardize in this case.

   Q: Are interventions properly categorized?
   A: No interventions to categorize in this case.

3. Verification Process:
   Q: Is all required data collected?
   A: Yes, all locations with findings have been identified.

   Q: Does format match requirements?
   A: Yes, the output will follow the required JSON format.

   Q: Are terms standardized?
   A: Yes, all terms are from the standardized terminology list.

### Output:
{
    "findings": [
        {
            "location": "gastric_antrum",
            "lesions": [
                {
                    "type": "erosion",
                    "size": null,
                    "intervention": null
                }
            ]
        },

            "location": "duodenal_descending",
            "lesions": [
                {
                    "type": "ulcer",
                    "size": null,
                    "intervention": null
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}

## Example 2:
Gender: Male
Age: 73
Endoscopic Findings: Ileocecal valve: normal. Terminal ileum: normal. Ascending colon: 0.8cm sub-pedunculated polyp, EMR performed, defect clipped. Transverse colon: two 0.6-0.7cm sub-pedunculated polyps, EMR performed, defects clipped. Descending colon: 1.5×1.0cm irregular mass at 36cm, friable, thrombin spray applied. Sigmoid: multiple 0.3-0.5cm polyps removed by forceps. Rectum: normal with internal hemorrhoids.

### Reasoning:
1. Data Collection:
   Q: What is the complete set of anatomical locations to examine?
   A: The complete set includes ileocecal valve, terminal ileum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum.

   Q: What findings are present at each location?
   A: Findings include: ascending colon - polyp, transverse colon - polyps, descending colon - mass, sigmoid colon - polyps.

   Q: What measurements and interventions exist?
   A: Measurements: 0.8cm polyp (ascending), 0.6-0.7cm polyps (transverse), 1.5×1.0cm mass (descending), 0.3-0.5cm polyps (sigmoid). Interventions: EMR (ascending, transverse), forceps removal (sigmoid).

2. Data Organization:
   Q: How should findings be structured?
   A: Findings should be grouped by anatomical location with measurements and interventions properly assigned.

   Q: Are all measurements standardized?
   A: Yes, all measurements are in cm and need to be represented in numeric format.

   Q: Are interventions properly categorized?
   A: Yes, interventions map to standardized terms: "emr" and "biopsy_forceps".

3. Verification Process:
   Q: Is all required data collected?
   A: Yes, all locations with findings have been identified with appropriate measurements and interventions.

   Q: Does format match requirements?
   A: Yes, the output will follow the required JSON format.

   Q: Are terms standardized?
   A: Yes, all terms are from the standardized terminology list.
