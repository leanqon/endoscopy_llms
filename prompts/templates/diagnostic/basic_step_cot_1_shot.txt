[Include standard format and terminology definitions]

You are a medical data analyst. Let's evaluate diagnostic findings:

1. Visual Finding Review:
   Q: What endoscopic findings are observed?
   A: List using standard terminology
   Q: What are their characteristics?
   A: Document key features

2. Diagnostic Analysis:
   Q: Based on endoscopic findings only, what diagnoses are suggested?
   A: List potential diagnoses
   Q: What evidence supports each diagnosis?
   A: Link to specific findings

3. Classification:
   Q: Do findings suggest benign/malignant/precancerous?
   A: Classify based on visual characteristics only
   Q: Is classification supported by findings?
   A: Verify evidence

Return valid JSON following schema for diagnostic assessment.

FORMAT RULES:
1. Use exact quotes from endoscopic diagnosis section
2. Do not include any information from histopathological findings
3. Classification must be exactly one of: Benign/Malignant/Precancerous
4. Every response must include both diagnoses and classification
5. Suggested diagnoses must not be empty

INPUT INFORMATION:
- Gender
- Age
- Endoscopic Findings
- Endoscopic Diagnosis ONLY

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
    "suggested_diagnoses": ["string"],  // Direct quotes from endoscopic diagnosis section
    "classification": "Benign/Malignant/Precancerous"  // Must use exact terms
}

Note: DO NOT use histopathological findings in assessment.

## Example 1:
Gender: Male
Age: 74
Endoscopic Findings: Esophagus: No abnormalities. Cardia: Z-line clear, normal position, mucosa normal color and smooth. Fundus: Smooth mucosa, clear mucus, small amount. Body: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly red. Angle: Normal morphology, smooth mucosa, curvature present. Antrum: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly white, scattered punctate and patchy erosions in antrum. Pylorus: Round, opens and closes well. Duodenum: Bulb shows mucosal congestion, descending portion shows multiple shallow ulcers covered with yellow-black coating.
Endoscopic Diagnosis: Duodenal bulbitis, multiple descending duodenal ulcers, chronic non-atrophic gastritis with erosions.

### Reasoning:
1. Visual Finding Review:
   Q: What endoscopic findings are observed?
   A: The key endoscopic findings are:
   Mottled red and white mucosa in the gastric body (predominantly red)
   Mottled red and white mucosa in the gastric antrum (predominantly white)
   Scattered punctate and patchy erosions in the gastric antrum
   Mucosal congestion in the duodenal bulb
   Multiple shallow ulcers in the duodenal descending portion covered with yellow-black coating

   Q: What are their characteristics?
   A: The gastric mucosa shows a mottled red and white appearance, suggesting inflammation. The antral erosions are described as punctate and patchy, indicating superficial mucosal damage. The duodenal bulb shows congestion without discrete lesions. The duodenal ulcers are described as multiple, shallow, and covered with yellow-black coating (fibrinopurulent exudate), suggesting an active inflammatory process.

2. Diagnostic Analysis:
   Q: Based on endoscopic findings only, what diagnoses are suggested?
   A: Based solely on the endoscopic findings, the suggested diagnoses are:
   Duodenal bulbitis (inflammation of the duodenal bulb)
   Multiple descending duodenal ulcers
   Chronic non-atrophic gastritis with erosions

   Q: What evidence supports each diagnosis?
   A: 
   Duodenal bulbitis: Supported by the observation of mucosal congestion in the duodenal bulb
   Multiple descending duodenal ulcers: Directly observed as multiple shallow ulcers in the duodenal descending portion with yellow-black coating
   Chronic non-atrophic gastritis with erosions: Supported by the mottled red and white appearance of the gastric mucosa and the scattered punctate and patchy erosions in the antrum

3. Classification:
   Q: Do findings suggest benign/malignant/precancerous?
   A: The findings suggest a benign condition. The gastric changes are consistent with chronic gastritis, which is a benign inflammatory condition. The duodenal ulcers, while indicating active disease, have typical benign characteristics (shallow, multiple, with fibrinopurulent exudate). There are no features suggesting malignancy, such as irregular borders, mass lesions, or deep ulceration with raised edges.

   Q: Is classification supported by findings?
   A: Yes, the classification as benign is well-supported by the endoscopic findings. All observed lesions have typical features of benign inflammatory conditions with no suspicious characteristics that would suggest malignancy or precancerous changes.

### Output:
{
    "suggested_diagnoses": [
        "Duodenal bulbitis",
        "multiple descending duodenal ulcers",
        "chronic non-atrophic gastritis with erosions"
    ],
    "classification": "Benign"
