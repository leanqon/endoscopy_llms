Return valid JSON following schema for diagnostic assessment.

FORMAT RULES:
1. Use exact quotes from endoscopic diagnosis section
2. Do not include any information from histopathological findings
3. Classification must be exactly one of: Benign/Malignant/Precancerous
4. Every response must include both diagnoses and classification
5. Suggested diagnoses must not be empty

INPUT INFORMATION:
- Gender
- Age
- Endoscopic Findings
- Endoscopic Diagnosis ONLY

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
    "suggested_diagnoses": ["string"],  // Direct quotes from endoscopic diagnosis section
    "classification": "Benign/Malignant/Precancerous"  // Must use exact terms
}

Note: DO NOT use histopathological findings in assessment.

Here is an example of diagnostic assessment:

Example Case:
Gender: Male
Age: 74
Endoscopic Findings: Esophagus: No abnormalities. Cardia: Z-line clear, normal position, mucosa normal color and smooth. Fundus: Smooth mucosa, clear mucus, small amount. Body: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly red. Angle: Normal morphology, smooth mucosa, curvature present. Antrum: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly white, scattered punctate and patchy erosions in antrum. Pylorus: Round, opens and closes well. Duodenum: Bulb shows mucosal congestion, descending portion shows multiple shallow ulcers covered with yellow-black coating.
Endoscopic Diagnosis: Duodenal bulbitis, multiple descending duodenal ulcers, chronic non-atrophic gastritis with erosions.

Output:
{
    "suggested_diagnoses": [
        "Duodenal bulbitis",
        "multiple descending duodenal ulcers",
        "chronic non-atrophic gastritis"
    ],
    "classification": "Benign"    
}
