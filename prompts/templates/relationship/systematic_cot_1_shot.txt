You are a medical data analyst. Let's analyze patterns systematically:

1. Pattern Data Collection:
   Q: What is the complete set of findings to analyze?
   A: List all findings systematically
   Q: Where is each finding located?
   A: Map to anatomical locations
   Q: What relationships exist between locations?
   A: Document spatial connections

2. Distribution Analysis:
   Q: How are findings distributed across locations?
   A: Analyze spatial patterns
   Q: What type of distribution is present?
   A: Evaluate using standard categories
   Q: Are there multiple distribution patterns?
   A: Document all patterns

3. Pattern Verification:
   Q: Is pattern classification complete?
   A: Check all findings
   Q: Does classification match standard definitions?
   A: Verify against criteria
   Q: Are all relationships documented?
   A: Review connections

Return valid JSON following format rules exactly.

FORMAT RULES:
1. At least one pattern must be documented
2. Use only standardized lesion types for finding_type
3. All locations must use standardized terms
4. Distribution must be one of: continuous, scattered, localized, diffuse
5. Multiple locations required for continuous/scattered/diffuse patterns
6. Single location only for localized pattern

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:

# Systematic Analysis CoT for Pattern Recognition (5-shot)

## Example 1:
Gender: Male
Age: 74
Endoscopic Findings: Esophagus: No abnormalities. Cardia: Z-line clear, normal position, mucosa normal color and smooth. Fundus: Smooth mucosa, clear mucus, small amount. Body: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly red. Angle: Normal morphology, smooth mucosa, curvature present. Antrum: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly white, scattered punctate and patchy erosions in antrum. Pylorus: Round, opens and closes well. Duodenum: Bulb shows mucosal congestion, descending portion shows multiple shallow ulcers covered with yellow-black coating.

### Reasoning:
1. Pattern Data Collection:
   Q: What is the complete set of findings to analyze?
   A: A systematic review of the endoscopic report reveals two main abnormal findings:
   - Scattered punctate and patchy erosions in the gastric antrum
   - Multiple shallow ulcers in the duodenal descending portion (with yellow-black coating)
   
   Other areas (esophagus, cardia, fundus, angle, pylorus) show no significant lesions, though there is mottled mucosa in the body and antrum, and mucosal congestion in the duodenal bulb.

   Q: Where is each finding located?
   A: Looking at standardized anatomical locations:
   - Erosions are located in the gastric_antrum
   - Ulcers are located in the duodenal_descending
   
   Both of these are specific, discrete anatomical locations within the upper GI tract.

   Q: What relationships exist between locations?
   A: The gastric_antrum and duodenal_descending are not directly adjacent - they are separated by the gastric_pylorus and duodenal_bulb. There is no description of continuous involvement across these regions, suggesting separate processes rather than a continuous phenomenon.

2. Distribution Analysis:
   Q: How are findings distributed across locations?
   A: Analyzing the spatial pattern:
   - Within the gastric_antrum: The erosions are described as "scattered punctate and patchy," indicating multiple discrete lesions distributed throughout this anatomical region but confined to it.
   - Within the duodenal_descending: The ulcers are described as "multiple," indicating several discrete lesions within this anatomical region.
   
   Neither finding extends beyond its respective anatomical region to adjacent areas.

   Q: What type of distribution is present?
   A: Based on the description:
   - The erosions in the gastric_antrum fit the definition of a "scattered" distribution - multiple discrete lesions within a single anatomical location.
   - The ulcers in the duodenal_descending also fit the definition of a "scattered" distribution - multiple discrete lesions within a single anatomical location.
   
   Neither pattern meets criteria for "continuous" (spanning adjacent locations), "diffuse" (widespread involvement across multiple locations), or "localized" (single lesion at a single location).

   Q: Are there multiple distribution patterns?
   A: Yes, there are two distinct patterns, each involving different lesion types and different anatomical locations:
   1. Scattered erosions in the gastric_antrum
   2. Scattered ulcers in the duodenal_descending

3. Pattern Verification:
   Q: Is pattern classification complete?
   A: Yes, all abnormal findings have been systematically analyzed and classified. The erosions in the gastric_antrum and the ulcers in the duodenal_descending have both been classified as having a "scattered" distribution pattern.

   Q: Does classification match standard definitions?
   A: Yes, the classification is consistent with standard definitions:
   - "Scattered" is defined as multiple discrete findings within a single anatomical location.
   - This accurately describes both the erosions in the gastric_antrum and the ulcers in the duodenal_descending.

   Q: Are all relationships documented?
   A: Yes, the spatial relationships have been documented. The erosions and ulcers occur in separate, non-adjacent anatomical locations (gastric_antrum and duodenal_descending), with no described continuity between them.
