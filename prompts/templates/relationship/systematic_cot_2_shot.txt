# Systematic Analysis CoT for Pattern Recognition (5-shot)

## Example 1:
Gender: Male
Age: 74
Endoscopic Findings: Esophagus: No abnormalities. Cardia: Z-line clear, normal position, mucosa normal color and smooth. Fundus: Smooth mucosa, clear mucus, small amount. Body: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly red. Angle: Normal morphology, smooth mucosa, curvature present. Antrum: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly white, scattered punctate and patchy erosions in antrum. Pylorus: Round, opens and closes well. Duodenum: Bulb shows mucosal congestion, descending portion shows multiple shallow ulcers covered with yellow-black coating.

### Reasoning:
1. Pattern Data Collection:
   Q: What is the complete set of findings to analyze?
   A: A systematic review of the endoscopic report reveals two main abnormal findings:
   - Scattered punctate and patchy erosions in the gastric antrum
   - Multiple shallow ulcers in the duodenal descending portion (with yellow-black coating)
   
   Other areas (esophagus, cardia, fundus, angle, pylorus) show no significant lesions, though there is mottled mucosa in the body and antrum, and mucosal congestion in the duodenal bulb.

   Q: Where is each finding located?
   A: Looking at standardized anatomical locations:
   - Erosions are located in the gastric_antrum
   - Ulcers are located in the duodenal_descending
   
   Both of these are specific, discrete anatomical locations within the upper GI tract.

   Q: What relationships exist between locations?
   A: The gastric_antrum and duodenal_descending are not directly adjacent - they are separated by the gastric_pylorus and duodenal_bulb. There is no description of continuous involvement across these regions, suggesting separate processes rather than a continuous phenomenon.

2. Distribution Analysis:
   Q: How are findings distributed across locations?
   A: Analyzing the spatial pattern:
   - Within the gastric_antrum: The erosions are described as "scattered punctate and patchy," indicating multiple discrete lesions distributed throughout this anatomical region but confined to it.
   - Within the duodenal_descending: The ulcers are described as "multiple," indicating several discrete lesions within this anatomical region.
   
   Neither finding extends beyond its respective anatomical region to adjacent areas.

   Q: What type of distribution is present?
   A: Based on the description:
   - The erosions in the gastric_antrum fit the definition of a "scattered" distribution - multiple discrete lesions within a single anatomical location.
   - The ulcers in the duodenal_descending also fit the definition of a "scattered" distribution - multiple discrete lesions within a single anatomical location.
   
   Neither pattern meets criteria for "continuous" (spanning adjacent locations), "diffuse" (widespread involvement across multiple locations), or "localized" (single lesion at a single location).

   Q: Are there multiple distribution patterns?
   A: Yes, there are two distinct patterns, each involving different lesion types and different anatomical locations:
   1. Scattered erosions in the gastric_antrum
   2. Scattered ulcers in the duodenal_descending

3. Pattern Verification:
   Q: Is pattern classification complete?
   A: Yes, all abnormal findings have been systematically analyzed and classified. The erosions in the gastric_antrum and the ulcers in the duodenal_descending have both been classified as having a "scattered" distribution pattern.

   Q: Does classification match standard definitions?
   A: Yes, the classification is consistent with standard definitions:
   - "Scattered" is defined as multiple discrete findings within a single anatomical location.
   - This accurately describes both the erosions in the gastric_antrum and the ulcers in the duodenal_descending.

   Q: Are all relationships documented?
   A: Yes, the spatial relationships have been documented. The erosions and ulcers occur in separate, non-adjacent anatomical locations (gastric_antrum and duodenal_descending), with no described continuity between them.

### Output:
{
    "patterns": [
        {
            "finding_type": "erosion",
            "locations": ["gastric_antrum"],
            "distribution": "scattered"
        },
        {
            "finding_type": "ulcer",
            "locations": ["duodenal_descending"],
            "distribution": "scattered"
        }
    ]
}

## Example 2:
Gender: Male
Age: 73
Endoscopic Findings: Ileocecal valve: normal. Terminal ileum: normal. Ascending colon: 0.8cm sub-pedunculated polyp, EMR performed, defect clipped. Transverse colon: two 0.6-0.7cm sub-pedunculated polyps, EMR performed, defects clipped. Descending colon: 1.5×1.0cm irregular mass at 36cm, friable, thrombin spray applied. Sigmoid: multiple 0.3-0.5cm polyps removed by forceps. Rectum: normal with internal hemorrhoids.

### Reasoning:
1. Pattern Data Collection:
   Q: What is the complete set of findings to analyze?
   A: A systematic review of the endoscopic report reveals the following abnormal findings:
   - One sub-pedunculated polyp (0.8cm) in the ascending colon
   - Two sub-pedunculated polyps (0.6-0.7cm) in the transverse colon
   - One irregular mass (1.5×1.0cm) in the descending colon
   - Multiple polyps (0.3-0.5cm) in the sigmoid colon
   
   Other areas (terminal ileum, ileocecal valve, rectum) appear normal, though internal hemorrhoids are noted in the rectum.

   Q: Where is each finding located?
   A: Looking at standardized anatomical locations:
   - Polyp is located in the ascending_colon
   - Polyps are located in the transverse_colon
   - Mass is located in the descending_colon
   - Polyps are located in the sigmoid_colon
   
   These represent distinct segments of the large intestine.

   Q: What relationships exist between locations?
   A: The findings involve multiple segments of the colon, but not in a continuous fashion. The findings in the ascending_colon, transverse_colon, and sigmoid_colon are all similar (polyps), suggesting a common process affecting multiple non-adjacent segments. The descending_colon finding is distinct (a mass rather than polyps).

2. Distribution Analysis:
   Q: How are findings distributed across locations?
   A: Analyzing the spatial pattern:
   - For polyps: They are found in three non-adjacent segments of the colon (ascending, transverse, sigmoid), suggesting a scattered distribution throughout the colon rather than a continuous or localized process.
   - For the mass: It is a solitary finding limited to the descending colon, suggesting a localized distribution.

   Q: What type of distribution is present?
   A: Based on the description:
   - The polyps fit the definition of a "scattered" distribution - similar lesions appearing in multiple non-adjacent locations (ascending_colon, transverse_colon, sigmoid_colon).
   - The mass fits the definition of a "localized" distribution - a single lesion limited to one location (descending_colon).

   Q: Are there multiple distribution patterns?
   A: Yes, there are two distinct patterns:
   1. Scattered polyps across three non-adjacent colonic segments
   2. Localized mass in the descending colon

3. Pattern Verification:
   Q: Is pattern classification complete?
   A: Yes, all abnormal findings have been systematically analyzed and classified. The polyps have been classified as having a "scattered" distribution across multiple colonic segments, and the mass has been classified as having a "localized" distribution in the descending colon.

   Q: Does classification match standard definitions?
   A: Yes, the classification is consistent with standard definitions:
   - "Scattered" is defined as multiple discrete findings across non-adjacent locations, which accurately describes the polyps in the ascending, transverse, and sigmoid colon.
   - "Localized" is defined as a single lesion limited to one location, which accurately describes the mass in the descending colon.

   Q: Are all relationships documented?
   A: Yes, the spatial relationships have been documented. The polyps occur in multiple non-adjacent segments (ascending, transverse, sigmoid), while the mass is limited to the descending colon.

### Output:
{
    "patterns": [
        {
            "finding_type": "polyp",
            "locations": ["ascending_colon", "transverse_colon", "sigmoid_colon"],
            "distribution": "scattered"
        },
