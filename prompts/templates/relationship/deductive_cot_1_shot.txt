[Include standard format and terminology definitions]

You are a medical data analyst. Let's reason deductively about distribution patterns:

1. Pattern Possibilities:
   Q: What distribution patterns could exist in this case?
   A: List all possible patterns
   Q: What evidence would support each pattern?
   A: Define criteria for each

2. Evidence Analysis:
   Q: What is the actual distribution of findings?
   A: Map documented locations
   Q: How do findings relate spatially?
   A: Analyze relationships
   Q: Which pattern criteria are met?
   A: Compare against definitions

3. Pattern Determination:
   Q: Which pattern is definitively present?
   A: Select based on evidence
   Q: Are there alternative explanations?
   A: Rule out other patterns
   Q: Is the conclusion supported?
   A: Verify evidence chain

Return valid JSON following format rules exactly.

FORMAT RULES:
1. At least one pattern must be documented
2. Use only standardized lesion types for finding_type
3. All locations must use standardized terms
4. Distribution must be one of: continuous, scattered, localized, diffuse
5. Multiple locations required for continuous/scattered/diffuse patterns
6. Single location only for localized pattern

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:

        {

## Example 1:
Gender: Male
Age: 74
Endoscopic Findings: Esophagus: No abnormalities. Cardia: Z-line clear, normal position, mucosa normal color and smooth. Fundus: Smooth mucosa, clear mucus, small amount. Body: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly red. Angle: Normal morphology, smooth mucosa, curvature present. Antrum: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly white, scattered punctate and patchy erosions in antrum. Pylorus: Round, opens and closes well. Duodenum: Bulb shows mucosal congestion, descending portion shows multiple shallow ulcers covered with yellow-black coating.

### Reasoning:
1. Pattern Possibilities:
   Q: What distribution patterns could exist in this case?
   A: Based on the endoscopic findings description, several possible distribution patterns could theoretically exist:
   
   - Continuous pattern: If lesions span adjacent anatomical locations without interruption
   - Scattered pattern: If multiple discrete lesions are present within one location or across non-adjacent locations
   - Localized pattern: If a single location has a single lesion
   - Diffuse pattern: If widespread involvement spans multiple locations
   
   I need to determine which of these patterns actually applies to the findings described.

   Q: What evidence would support each pattern?
   A: Evidence supporting each potential pattern would be:
   
   - Continuous: Description of lesions extending across adjacent anatomical regions without interruption
   - Scattered: Description of multiple discrete lesions confined to one region or similar lesions in non-adjacent regions
   - Localized: Description of a single lesion in a single location
   - Diffuse: Description of widespread involvement across multiple regions

2. Evidence Analysis:
   Q: What is the actual distribution of findings?
   A: Analyzing the report methodically:
   
   - Erosions are described as "scattered punctate and patchy" and are explicitly located in the "antrum"
   - Ulcers are described as "multiple shallow" and are explicitly located in the "duodenal descending portion"
   
   The erosions are confined to the gastric antrum and do not extend to adjacent regions. The ulcers are confined to the duodenal descending portion and do not extend to adjacent regions.

   Q: How do findings relate spatially?
   A: The erosions and ulcers are in separate, non-adjacent anatomical locations (gastric antrum and duodenal descending portion). There are no lesions described in the intervening regions (gastric pylorus, duodenal bulb). The two types of lesions (erosions and ulcers) are therefore spatially distinct and not part of a continuous process.

   Q: Which pattern criteria are met?
   A: Based on the evidence:
   
   - For the gastric antrum erosions: They are described as "scattered" and "patchy," indicating multiple discrete lesions confined to the antrum. This meets the criteria for a "scattered" distribution pattern within a single location.
   - For the duodenal descending portion ulcers: They are described as "multiple," indicating several discrete lesions confined to the descending duodenum. This meets the criteria for a "scattered" distribution pattern within a single location.
   
   Neither finding meets criteria for "continuous" (no extension across adjacent regions), "diffuse" (no widespread involvement), or "localized" (not single lesions).

3. Pattern Determination:
   Q: Which pattern is definitively present?
   A: Through deductive reasoning, I can conclude:
   
   1. The gastric antrum erosions exhibit a "scattered" distribution pattern, with multiple discrete lesions confined to this single location.
   2. The duodenal descending portion ulcers exhibit a "scattered" distribution pattern, with multiple discrete lesions confined to this single location.

   Q: Are there alternative explanations?
   A: The only plausible alternative would be to consider these as "localized" patterns. However, this is ruled out because:
   
   - "Localized" requires a single lesion in a single location
   - Both the erosions and ulcers are described as multiple ("scattered," "patchy," "multiple")
   
   Therefore, "scattered" is the only pattern classification that fits the evidence.

   Q: Is the conclusion supported?
   A: Yes, the conclusion is firmly supported by the evidence in the report:
   
   - Explicit description of "scattered" erosions in the antrum
   - Explicit description of "multiple" ulcers in the duodenal descending portion
   - No description of continuity between regions
   - No description of widespread involvement across multiple regions
   
   This supports the classification of both findings as having a "scattered" distribution pattern.

### Output:
{
    "patterns": [
        {
            "finding_type": "erosion",
            "locations": ["gastric_antrum"],
