# Systematic Analysis CoT for Pattern Recognition (5-shot)

## Example 1:
Gender: Male
Age: 74
Endoscopic Findings: Esophagus: No abnormalities. Cardia: Z-line clear, normal position, mucosa normal color and smooth. Fundus: Smooth mucosa, clear mucus, small amount. Body: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly red. Angle: Normal morphology, smooth mucosa, curvature present. Antrum: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly white, scattered punctate and patchy erosions in antrum. Pylorus: Round, opens and closes well. Duodenum: Bulb shows mucosal congestion, descending portion shows multiple shallow ulcers covered with yellow-black coating.

### Reasoning:
1. Pattern Data Collection:
   Q: What is the complete set of findings to analyze?
   A: A systematic review of the endoscopic report reveals two main abnormal findings:
   - Scattered punctate and patchy erosions in the gastric antrum
   - Multiple shallow ulcers in the duodenal descending portion (with yellow-black coating)
   
   Other areas (esophagus, cardia, fundus, angle, pylorus) show no significant lesions, though there is mottled mucosa in the body and antrum, and mucosal congestion in the duodenal bulb.

   Q: Where is each finding located?
   A: Looking at standardized anatomical locations:
   - Erosions are located in the gastric_antrum
   - Ulcers are located in the duodenal_descending
   
   Both of these are specific, discrete anatomical locations within the upper GI tract.

   Q: What relationships exist between locations?
   A: The gastric_antrum and duodenal_descending are not directly adjacent - they are separated by the gastric_pylorus and duodenal_bulb. There is no description of continuous involvement across these regions, suggesting separate processes rather than a continuous phenomenon.

2. Distribution Analysis:
   Q: How are findings distributed across locations?
   A: Analyzing the spatial pattern:
   - Within the gastric_antrum: The erosions are described as "scattered punctate and patchy," indicating multiple discrete lesions distributed throughout this anatomical region but confined to it.
   - Within the duodenal_descending: The ulcers are described as "multiple," indicating several discrete lesions within this anatomical region.
   
   Neither finding extends beyond its respective anatomical region to adjacent areas.

   Q: What type of distribution is present?
   A: Based on the description:
   - The erosions in the gastric_antrum fit the definition of a "scattered" distribution - multiple discrete lesions within a single anatomical location.
   - The ulcers in the duodenal_descending also fit the definition of a "scattered" distribution - multiple discrete lesions within a single anatomical location.
   
   Neither pattern meets criteria for "continuous" (spanning adjacent locations), "diffuse" (widespread involvement across multiple locations), or "localized" (single lesion at a single location).

   Q: Are there multiple distribution patterns?
   A: Yes, there are two distinct patterns, each involving different lesion types and different anatomical locations:
   1. Scattered erosions in the gastric_antrum
   2. Scattered ulcers in the duodenal_descending

3. Pattern Verification:
   Q: Is pattern classification complete?
   A: Yes, all abnormal findings have been systematically analyzed and classified. The erosions in the gastric_antrum and the ulcers in the duodenal_descending have both been classified as having a "scattered" distribution pattern.

   Q: Does classification match standard definitions?
   A: Yes, the classification is consistent with standard definitions:
   - "Scattered" is defined as multiple discrete findings within a single anatomical location.
   - This accurately describes both the erosions in the gastric_antrum and the ulcers in the duodenal_descending.

   Q: Are all relationships documented?
   A: Yes, the spatial relationships have been documented. The erosions and ulcers occur in separate, non-adjacent anatomical locations (gastric_antrum and duodenal_descending), with no described continuity between them.

### Output:
{
    "patterns": [
        {
            "finding_type": "erosion",
            "locations": ["gastric_antrum"],
            "distribution": "scattered"
        },
        {
            "finding_type": "ulcer",
            "locations": ["duodenal_descending"],
            "distribution": "scattered"
        }
    ]
}

## Example 2:
Gender: Male
Age: 73
Endoscopic Findings: Ileocecal valve: normal. Terminal ileum: normal. Ascending colon: 0.8cm sub-pedunculated polyp, EMR performed, defect clipped. Transverse colon: two 0.6-0.7cm sub-pedunculated polyps, EMR performed, defects clipped. Descending colon: 1.5×1.0cm irregular mass at 36cm, friable, thrombin spray applied. Sigmoid: multiple 0.3-0.5cm polyps removed by forceps. Rectum: normal with internal hemorrhoids.

### Reasoning:
1. Pattern Data Collection:
   Q: What is the complete set of findings to analyze?
   A: A systematic review of the endoscopic report reveals the following abnormal findings:
   - One sub-pedunculated polyp (0.8cm) in the ascending colon
   - Two sub-pedunculated polyps (0.6-0.7cm) in the transverse colon
   - One irregular mass (1.5×1.0cm) in the descending colon
   - Multiple polyps (0.3-0.5cm) in the sigmoid colon
   
   Other areas (terminal ileum, ileocecal valve, rectum) appear normal, though internal hemorrhoids are noted in the rectum.

   Q: Where is each finding located?
   A: Looking at standardized anatomical locations:
   - Polyp is located in the ascending_colon
   - Polyps are located in the transverse_colon
   - Mass is located in the descending_colon
   - Polyps are located in the sigmoid_colon
   
   These represent distinct segments of the large intestine.

   Q: What relationships exist between locations?
   A: The findings involve multiple segments of the colon, but not in a continuous fashion. The findings in the ascending_colon, transverse_colon, and sigmoid_colon are all similar (polyps), suggesting a common process affecting multiple non-adjacent segments. The descending_colon finding is distinct (a mass rather than polyps).

2. Distribution Analysis:
   Q: How are findings distributed across locations?
   A: Analyzing the spatial pattern:
   - For polyps: They are found in three non-adjacent segments of the colon (ascending, transverse, sigmoid), suggesting a scattered distribution throughout the colon rather than a continuous or localized process.
   - For the mass: It is a solitary finding limited to the descending colon, suggesting a localized distribution.

   Q: What type of distribution is present?
   A: Based on the description:
   - The polyps fit the definition of a "scattered" distribution - similar lesions appearing in multiple non-adjacent locations (ascending_colon, transverse_colon, sigmoid_colon).
   - The mass fits the definition of a "localized" distribution - a single lesion limited to one location (descending_colon).

   Q: Are there multiple distribution patterns?
   A: Yes, there are two distinct patterns:
   1. Scattered polyps across three non-adjacent colonic segments
   2. Localized mass in the descending colon

3. Pattern Verification:
   Q: Is pattern classification complete?
   A: Yes, all abnormal findings have been systematically analyzed and classified. The polyps have been classified as having a "scattered" distribution across multiple colonic segments, and the mass has been classified as having a "localized" distribution in the descending colon.

   Q: Does classification match standard definitions?
   A: Yes, the classification is consistent with standard definitions:
   - "Scattered" is defined as multiple discrete findings across non-adjacent locations, which accurately describes the polyps in the ascending, transverse, and sigmoid colon.
   - "Localized" is defined as a single lesion limited to one location, which accurately describes the mass in the descending colon.

   Q: Are all relationships documented?
   A: Yes, the spatial relationships have been documented. The polyps occur in multiple non-adjacent segments (ascending, transverse, sigmoid), while the mass is limited to the descending colon.

### Output:
{
    "patterns": [
        {
            "finding_type": "polyp",
            "locations": ["ascending_colon", "transverse_colon", "sigmoid_colon"],
            "distribution": "scattered"
        },
        {
            "finding_type": "mass",
            "locations": ["descending_colon"],
            "distribution": "localized"
        }
    ]
}

## Example 3:
Gender: Male
Age: 34
Endoscopic Findings: Esophagus: two varices beyond 30cm with red signs, sclerotherapy performed (6ml polidocanol). Stomach: mosaic pattern, antral erosions, 0.3cm ulcer. Duodenum: 0.5cm hyperplastic polyp in descending part.

### Reasoning:
1. Pattern Data Collection:
   Q: What is the complete set of findings to analyze?
   A: A systematic review of the endoscopic report reveals the following abnormal findings:
   - Two varices beyond 30cm in the esophagus
   - Erosions in the antral region of the stomach
   - A 0.3cm ulcer in the stomach (presumably in the antrum given the context)
   - A 0.5cm hyperplastic polyp in the descending part of the duodenum
   
   Additionally, a mosaic pattern is noted in the stomach, consistent with portal hypertensive gastropathy.

   Q: Where is each finding located?
   A: Looking at standardized anatomical locations:
   - Varices are located in the esophagus_middle (based on the 30cm distance from incisors)
   - Erosions are located in the gastric_antrum
   - Ulcer is located in the gastric_antrum
   - Polyp is located in the duodenal_descending
   
   These represent distinct anatomical areas within the upper GI tract.

   Q: What relationships exist between locations?
   A: The findings involve multiple segments of the upper GI tract that are not adjacent. The esophageal varices are separated from the gastric findings by the upper esophagus and cardia. The gastric findings (erosions and ulcer) are in the same region (antrum). The duodenal polyp is separated from the gastric findings by the pylorus and duodenal bulb.

2. Distribution Analysis:
   Q: How are findings distributed across locations?
   A: Analyzing the spatial pattern:
   - For esophageal varices: The report describes "two varices," indicating multiple discrete vascular lesions in the mid-esophagus.
   - For gastric erosions: The term "erosions" (plural) suggests multiple lesions within the antrum.
   - For the gastric ulcer: This appears to be a single lesion in the antrum.
   - For the duodenal polyp: This is a single lesion in the descending duodenum.

   Q: What type of distribution is present?
   A: Based on the description:
   - The esophageal varices fit the definition of a "scattered" distribution - multiple discrete lesions within a single location.
   - The gastric erosions fit the definition of a "scattered" distribution - multiple lesions within a single location.
   - The gastric ulcer fits the definition of a "localized" distribution - a single lesion within a single location.
   - The duodenal polyp fits the definition of a "localized" distribution - a single lesion within a single location.

   Q: Are there multiple distribution patterns?
   A: Yes, there are four distinct patterns:
   1. Scattered varices (classified as "mass" in our standardized terms) in the mid-esophagus
   2. Scattered erosions in the gastric antrum
   3. Localized ulcer in the gastric antrum
   4. Localized polyp in the descending duodenum

3. Pattern Verification:
   Q: Is pattern classification complete?
   A: Yes, all abnormal findings have been systematically analyzed and classified according to their distribution patterns.

   Q: Does classification match standard definitions?
   A: Yes, the classification is consistent with standard definitions:
   - "Scattered" is defined as multiple discrete findings within a single location, which accurately describes the esophageal varices and gastric erosions.
   - "Localized" is defined as a single lesion limited to one location, which accurately describes the gastric ulcer and duodenal polyp.

   Q: Are all relationships documented?
   A: Yes, the spatial relationships have been documented. The findings occur in separate anatomical regions without continuous involvement between them.

## Example 4:
Gender: Female
Age: 63
Endoscopic Findings: Esophagus: No abnormalities. Cardia: Z-line clear, normal position, mucosa normal color and smooth. Fundus: Smooth mucosa, clear mucus, small amount. Body: Seven flat polyps seen, size ranging from 0.2cm-0.6cm, larger ones removed by snare electrocautery, smaller ones partially removed by biopsy forceps and electrocautery ablation. Angle: Normal morphology, smooth mucosa, curvature present. Antrum: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly red, one shallow ulcer approximately 0.2cm, surface covered with thin white coating, surrounding mucosa congested and edematous, scattered punctate and patchy erosions also seen. Pylorus: Round, opens and closes well. Duodenum: No abnormalities in bulb and descending portion.

### Reasoning:
1. Pattern Data Collection:
   Q: What is the complete set of findings to analyze?
   A: A systematic review of the endoscopic report reveals the following abnormal findings:
   - Seven flat polyps (0.2-0.6cm) in the gastric body
   - One shallow ulcer (0.2cm) in the gastric antrum
   - Scattered punctate and patchy erosions in the gastric antrum
   
   Additionally, mottled mucosa is noted in the antrum, but this is a mucosal characteristic rather than a discrete lesion.

   Q: Where is each finding located?
   A: Looking at standardized anatomical locations:
   - Polyps are located in the gastric_body
   - Ulcer is located in the gastric_antrum
   - Erosions are located in the gastric_antrum
   
   These represent distinct regions within the stomach.

   Q: What relationships exist between locations?
   A: The findings involve two adjacent regions of the stomach: the body and the antrum. The gastric body contains multiple polyps, while the gastric antrum contains a single ulcer and multiple erosions. There is no description of continuous involvement across these regions, suggesting separate processes rather than a continuous phenomenon.

2. Distribution Analysis:
   Q: How are findings distributed across locations?
   A: Analyzing the spatial pattern:
   - For gastric body polyps: The report describes "seven flat polyps," indicating multiple discrete lesions distributed throughout this region.
   - For the gastric antrum ulcer: This is described as "one shallow ulcer," indicating a single discrete lesion.
   - For gastric antrum erosions: These are described as "scattered punctate and patchy," indicating multiple discrete lesions distributed throughout this region.

   Q: What type of distribution is present?
   A: Based on the description:
   - The gastric body polyps fit the definition of a "scattered" distribution - multiple discrete lesions within a single location.
   - The gastric antrum ulcer fits the definition of a "localized" distribution - a single lesion within a single location.
   - The gastric antrum erosions fit the definition of a "scattered" distribution - multiple discrete lesions within a single location.

   Q: Are there multiple distribution patterns?
   A: Yes, there are three distinct patterns:
   1. Scattered polyps in the gastric body
   2. Localized ulcer in the gastric antrum
   3. Scattered erosions in the gastric antrum

3. Pattern Verification:
   Q: Is pattern classification complete?
   A: Yes, all abnormal findings have been systematically analyzed and classified according to their distribution patterns.

   Q: Does classification match standard definitions?
   A: Yes, the classification is consistent with standard definitions:
   - "Scattered" is defined as multiple discrete findings within a single location, which accurately describes the gastric body polyps and gastric antrum erosions.
   - "Localized" is defined as a single lesion limited to one location, which accurately describes the gastric antrum ulcer.

   Q: Are all relationships documented?
   A: Yes, the spatial relationships have been documented. The polyps are limited to the gastric body, while the ulcer and erosions are limited to the gastric antrum, with no description of continuous involvement across these regions.

## Example 5:
Gender: Female
Age: 48
Endoscopic Findings: Esophagus: Scattered patchy mucosal defects >5mm in lower portion, non-confluent. Cardia: Clear Z-line, normal position with smooth mucosa. Gastric fundus: Smooth mucosa with clear minimal mucus. Gastric body: 4mm flat polyp on upper greater curvature, smooth surface, removed by biopsy forceps. Gastric angle: Normal morphology with smooth mucosa and preserved curvature. Gastric antrum: Red and white mottled mucosa, predominantly red, with scattered patchy erosions. Pylorus: Round with good function. Duodenum: Unremarkable bulb and descending portion.

### Reasoning:
1. Pattern Data Collection:
   Q: What is the complete set of findings to analyze?
   A: A systematic review of the endoscopic report reveals the following abnormal findings:
   - Scattered patchy mucosal defects (>5mm) in the lower esophagus, described as non-confluent
   - One flat polyp (4mm) in the gastric body on the upper greater curvature
   - Scattered patchy erosions in the gastric antrum
   
   Additionally, mottled mucosa is noted in the antrum, but this is a mucosal characteristic rather than a discrete lesion.

   Q: Where is each finding located?
   A: Looking at standardized anatomical locations:
   - Mucosal defects are located in the esophagus_lower
   - Polyp is located in the gastric_body
   - Erosions are located in the gastric_antrum
   
   These represent distinct regions within the upper GI tract.

   Q: What relationships exist between locations?
   A: The findings involve three separate regions: the lower esophagus, the gastric body, and the gastric antrum. There is no description of continuous involvement across these regions, suggesting separate processes rather than a continuous phenomenon.

2. Distribution Analysis:
   Q: How are findings distributed across locations?
   A: Analyzing the spatial pattern:
   - For esophageal mucosal defects: These are described as "scattered patchy" and "non-confluent," indicating multiple discrete lesions distributed throughout the lower esophagus.
   - For the gastric body polyp: This is described as "4mm flat polyp on upper greater curvature," indicating a single discrete lesion at a specific site.
   - For gastric antrum erosions: These are described as "scattered patchy," indicating multiple discrete lesions distributed throughout the antrum.

   Q: What type of distribution is present?
   A: Based on the description:
   - The esophageal mucosal defects fit the definition of a "scattered" distribution - multiple discrete lesions within a single location, explicitly described as "non-confluent."
   - The gastric body polyp fits the definition of a "localized" distribution - a single lesion at a specific site within a single location.
   - The gastric antrum erosions fit the definition of a "scattered" distribution - multiple discrete lesions within a single location.

   Q: Are there multiple distribution patterns?
   A: Yes, there are three distinct patterns:
   1. Scattered mucosal defects in the lower esophagus
   2. Localized polyp in the gastric body
   3. Scattered erosions in the gastric antrum

3. Pattern Verification:
   Q: Is pattern classification complete?
   A: Yes, all abnormal findings have been systematically analyzed and classified according to their distribution patterns.

   Q: Does classification match standard definitions?
   A: Yes, the classification is consistent with standard definitions:
   - "Scattered" is defined as multiple discrete findings within a single location, which accurately describes the esophageal mucosal defects and gastric antrum erosions.
   - "Localized" is defined as a single lesion limited to one location, which accurately describes the gastric body polyp.

   Q: Are all relationships documented?
   A: Yes, the spatial relationships have been documented. The findings occur in separate anatomical regions without continuous involvement between them.
