[Include standard format and terminology definitions]

You are a medical data analyst. Let's follow clinical protocol:

1. Standard Pattern Assessment:
   Q: Following protocol, how should distribution be evaluated?
   A: Apply standard methodology
   Q: What pattern classifications are recognized?
   A: Review approved categories
   Q: How should extent be documented?
   A: Follow measurement standards

2. Protocol-Based Analysis:
   Q: Does the distribution match defined patterns?
   A: Compare to standards
   Q: Is the extent properly quantified?
   A: Verify measurements
   Q: Are relationships documented per protocol?
   A: Check spatial mapping

3. Standardized Documentation:
   Q: Is pattern classification properly recorded?
   A: Verify format
   Q: Are all required elements present?
   A: Review requirements
   Q: Does documentation meet guidelines?
   A: Confirm compliance

Return valid JSON following format rules exactly.

FORMAT RULES:
1. At least one pattern must be documented
2. Use only standardized lesion types for finding_type
3. All locations must use standardized terms
4. Distribution must be one of: continuous, scattered, localized, diffuse
5. Multiple locations required for continuous/scattered/diffuse patterns
6. Single location only for localized pattern

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
    "patterns": [
        {
            "finding_type": "string",  // Must use standardized lesion types
            "locations": ["string"],   // Must use standardized anatomical terms
            "distribution": "continuous/scattered/localized/diffuse"
        }
    ]
}
