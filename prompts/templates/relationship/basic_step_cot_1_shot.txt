[Include standard format and terminology definitions]

You are a medical data annotator. Let's analyze distribution patterns:

1. Finding Inventory:
   Q: What types of findings are present?
   A: List all findings using standard terms
   Q: Where are these findings located?
   A: Map to anatomical locations

2. Distribution Analysis:
   Q: How are findings spread across locations?
   A: Examine spatial relationships
   Q: Do findings span multiple locations?
   A: Note connections between areas

3. Pattern Classification:
   Q: What distribution pattern best describes these findings?
   A: Choose from: continuous/scattered/localized/diffuse
   Q: Does the pattern match standard definitions?
   A: Verify against criteria

Return valid JSON following format rules exactly.

FORMAT RULES:
1. At least one pattern must be documented
2. Use only standardized lesion types for finding_type
3. All locations must use standardized terms
4. Distribution must be one of: continuous, scattered, localized, diffuse
5. Multiple locations required for continuous/scattered/diffuse patterns
6. Single location only for localized pattern

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
    "patterns": [
        {
            "finding_type": "string",  // Must use standardized lesion types
            "locations": ["string"],   // Must use standardized anatomical terms
            "distribution": "continuous/scattered/localized/diffuse"
        }
    ]
}

STANDARDIZED TERMS:
Anatomical Locations:
Upper GI:
- esophagus_upper, esophagus_middle, esophagus_lower
- gastric_cardia, gastric_fundus, gastric_body, gastric_angle, gastric_antrum, gastric_pylorus
- duodenal_bulb, duodenal_descending

Lower GI:
- terminal_ileum
- ileocecal_valve, appendiceal_orifice
- ascending_colon, transverse_colon, descending_colon
- sigmoid_colon, rectum

Lesion Types:
- polyp, ulcer, erosion, mass, elevation
- mucosal_defect, mucosal_patch
- diverticulum, lymphoid_hyperplasia

Intervention Types:
- biopsy_forceps, emr, esd, ster
- polypectomy, apc, injection
- clipping, hemostasis
- submucosal_dissection

## Example 1:
Gender: Male
Age: 74
Endoscopic Findings: Esophagus: No abnormalities. Cardia: Z-line clear, normal position, mucosa normal color and smooth. Fundus: Smooth mucosa, clear mucus, small amount. Body: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly red. Angle: Normal morphology, smooth mucosa, curvature present. Antrum: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly white, scattered punctate and patchy erosions in antrum. Pylorus: Round, opens and closes well. Duodenum: Bulb shows mucosal congestion, descending portion shows multiple shallow ulcers covered with yellow-black coating.

### Reasoning:
1. Finding Inventory:
   Q: What types of findings are present?
   A: The report describes two types of findings: erosions in the antrum and ulcers in the duodenal descending portion.

   Q: Where are these findings located?
   A: The erosions are located in the gastric_antrum. The ulcers are located in the duodenal_descending.

2. Distribution Analysis:
   Q: How are findings spread across locations?
   A: The erosions are described as "scattered punctate and patchy" in the antrum, indicating they are distributed throughout this region but limited to it. The ulcers are described as "multiple" in the duodenal descending portion, suggesting several ulcers within this single location.

   Q: Do findings span multiple locations?
   A: No, each type of finding is confined to a specific location. The erosions are only in the gastric antrum, and the ulcers are only in the duodenal descending portion.

3. Pattern Classification:
   Q: What distribution pattern best describes these findings?
   A: For the erosions in the gastric antrum, they are described as "scattered" within this single location, which matches the "scattered" distribution pattern. For the ulcers in the duodenal descending portion, they are described as "multiple" within this single location, which also indicates a "scattered" pattern.

   Q: Does the pattern match standard definitions?
   A: Yes, "scattered" is defined as multiple discrete findings distributed across a location, which matches both the erosions in the antrum and the ulcers in the duodenal descending portion.

### Output:
{
    "patterns": [
        {
            "finding_type": "erosion",
            "locations": ["gastric_antrum"],
