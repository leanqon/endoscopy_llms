2. Protocol-Based Analysis:
   Q: Does the distribution match defined patterns?

   A: Verify format
   Q: Are all required elements present?
   A: Review requirements
   Q: Does documentation meet guidelines?
   A: Confirm compliance

Return valid JSON following format rules exactly.

FORMAT RULES:
1. At least one pattern must be documented
2. Use only standardized lesion types for finding_type
3. All locations must use standardized terms
4. Distribution must be one of: continuous, scattered, localized, diffuse
5. Multiple locations required for continuous/scattered/diffuse patterns
6. Single location only for localized pattern

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
    "patterns": [
        {
            "finding_type": "string",  // Must use standardized lesion types
            "locations": ["string"],   // Must use standardized anatomical terms
            "distribution": "continuous/scattered/localized/diffuse"
        }
    ]

STANDARDIZED TERMS:
Anatomical Locations:
Upper GI:

- duodenal_bulb, duodenal_descending

Lower GI:
- terminal_ileum
- ileocecal_valve, appendiceal_orifice
- ascending_colon, transverse_colon, descending_colon
- sigmoid_colon, rectum

Lesion Types:
- polyp, ulcer, erosion, mass, elevation
- mucosal_defect, mucosal_patch
- diverticulum, lymphoid_hyperplasia

Intervention Types:
- biopsy_forceps, emr, esd, ster
- polypectomy, apc, injection
- clipping, hemostasis

## Example 1:
Gender: Male
Age: 74
Endoscopic Findings: Esophagus: No abnormalities. Cardia: Z-line clear, normal position, mucosa normal color and smooth. Fundus: Smooth mucosa, clear mucus, small amount. Body: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly red. Angle: Normal morphology, smooth mucosa, curvature present. Antrum: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly white, scattered punctate and patchy erosions in antrum. Pylorus: Round, opens and closes well. Duodenum: Bulb shows mucosal congestion, descending portion shows multiple shallow ulcers covered with yellow-black coating.

### Reasoning:
1. Standard Pattern Assessment:
   Q: Following protocol, how should distribution be evaluated?
   A: According to standard endoscopic documentation protocols, the distribution of lesions should be evaluated by:
   1. Identifying the anatomical location(s) where each type of finding is present
   2. Determining whether lesions are single or multiple within each location
   3. Assessing whether lesions span across adjacent anatomical regions or are confined to specific locations
   4. Categorizing the distribution pattern according to standardized definitions (continuous, scattered, localized, diffuse)

   In this case, I must evaluate the distribution of erosions in the gastric antrum and ulcers in the duodenal descending portion.

   Q: What pattern classifications are recognized?
   A: The standard pattern classifications in endoscopic documentation are:
   - Continuous: Findings span adjacent anatomical locations without interruption
   - Scattered: Multiple discrete findings distributed within one location or across non-adjacent locations
   - Localized: Single location involvement with one or more findings
   - Diffuse: Widespread involvement across multiple locations

   Q: How should extent be documented?
   A: The extent should be documented by specifying:
   1. The precise anatomical location(s) using standardized terminology
   2. The distribution pattern for each finding type
   3. Any relevant qualifiers (e.g., "multiple," "scattered," "patchy") that appear in the report

2. Protocol-Based Analysis:
   Q: Does the distribution match defined patterns?
   A: Analyzing each finding type:
   - Erosions in gastric antrum: The report describes "scattered punctate and patchy erosions in antrum." This indicates multiple discrete lesions within a single anatomical location, which matches the definition of a "scattered" distribution pattern.
   - Ulcers in duodenal descending portion: The report describes "multiple shallow ulcers." This indicates multiple discrete lesions within a single anatomical location, which matches the definition of a "scattered" distribution pattern.

   Neither finding extends beyond its anatomical region to adjacent areas, so they do not qualify as "continuous" or "diffuse." Both findings involve multiple lesions within a single location, so they are best classified as "scattered" rather than "localized."

   Q: Is the extent properly quantified?
   A: The extent is qualitatively described but not precisely quantified:
   - For the erosions, terms like "scattered" and "patchy" indicate multiple lesions but do not specify an exact number.
   - For the ulcers, the term "multiple" indicates more than one but does not specify an exact number.

   While precise quantification would be ideal, these qualitative descriptors are acceptable according to standard documentation protocols when exact counts are not provided.

   Q: Are relationships documented per protocol?
   A: The spatial relationships are appropriately documented:
   - The erosions are explicitly confined to the gastric antrum.
   - The ulcers are explicitly confined to the duodenal descending portion.
   - There is no described continuity between these findings, and they occur in non-adjacent anatomical regions.

   This level of documentation meets standard protocol requirements for describing the spatial distribution of findings.

3. Standardized Documentation:
   Q: Is pattern classification properly recorded?
   A: Based on the analysis, the appropriate pattern classifications are:
   - Erosions in gastric antrum: "scattered" distribution
   - Ulcers in duodenal descending portion: "scattered" distribution

   This classification follows standard protocol and accurately reflects the description in the endoscopic report.

   Q: Are all required elements present?
   A: The required elements for standardized documentation are:
   - Finding type (using standardized terminology): "erosion" and "ulcer"
   - Anatomical location(s) (using standardized terminology): "gastric_antrum" and "duodenal_descending"
   - Distribution pattern (using standardized classification): "scattered" for both

   All these elements are present and can be properly formatted according to the required JSON structure.

   Q: Does documentation meet guidelines?
   A: Yes, the documentation meets standard guidelines for endoscopic reporting. The findings are described with appropriate anatomical precision, standard terminology is used, and the distribution patterns can be accurately classified based on the information provided.
