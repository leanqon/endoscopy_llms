## Example 1:
Gender: Male
Age: 74
Endoscopic Findings: Esophagus: No abnormalities. Cardia: Z-line clear, normal position, mucosa normal color and smooth. Fundus: Smooth mucosa, clear mucus, small amount. Body: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly red. Angle: Normal morphology, smooth mucosa, curvature present. Antrum: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly white, scattered punctate and patchy erosions in antrum. Pylorus: Round, opens and closes well. Duodenum: Bulb shows mucosal congestion, descending portion shows multiple shallow ulcers covered with yellow-black coating.

### Reasoning:
1. Standard Pattern Assessment:
   Q: Following protocol, how should distribution be evaluated?
   A: According to standard endoscopic documentation protocols, the distribution of lesions should be evaluated by:
   1. Identifying the anatomical location(s) where each type of finding is present
   2. Determining whether lesions are single or multiple within each location
   3. Assessing whether lesions span across adjacent anatomical regions or are confined to specific locations
   4. Categorizing the distribution pattern according to standardized definitions (continuous, scattered, localized, diffuse)

   In this case, I must evaluate the distribution of erosions in the gastric antrum and ulcers in the duodenal descending portion.

   Q: What pattern classifications are recognized?
   A: The standard pattern classifications in endoscopic documentation are:
   - Continuous: Findings span adjacent anatomical locations without interruption
   - Scattered: Multiple discrete findings distributed within one location or across non-adjacent locations
   - Localized: Single location involvement with one or more findings
   - Diffuse: Widespread involvement across multiple locations

   Q: How should extent be documented?
   A: The extent should be documented by specifying:
   1. The precise anatomical location(s) using standardized terminology
   2. The distribution pattern for each finding type
   3. Any relevant qualifiers (e.g., "multiple," "scattered," "patchy") that appear in the report

2. Protocol-Based Analysis:
   Q: Does the distribution match defined patterns?
   A: Analyzing each finding type:
   - Erosions in gastric antrum: The report describes "scattered punctate and patchy erosions in antrum." This indicates multiple discrete lesions within a single anatomical location, which matches the definition of a "scattered" distribution pattern.
   - Ulcers in duodenal descending portion: The report describes "multiple shallow ulcers." This indicates multiple discrete lesions within a single anatomical location, which matches the definition of a "scattered" distribution pattern.

   Neither finding extends beyond its anatomical region to adjacent areas, so they do not qualify as "continuous" or "diffuse." Both findings involve multiple lesions within a single location, so they are best classified as "scattered" rather than "localized."

   Q: Is the extent properly quantified?
   A: The extent is qualitatively described but not precisely quantified:
   - For the erosions, terms like "scattered" and "patchy" indicate multiple lesions but do not specify an exact number.
   - For the ulcers, the term "multiple" indicates more than one but does not specify an exact number.

   While precise quantification would be ideal, these qualitative descriptors are acceptable according to standard documentation protocols when exact counts are not provided.

   Q: Are relationships documented per protocol?
   A: The spatial relationships are appropriately documented:
   - The erosions are explicitly confined to the gastric antrum.
   - The ulcers are explicitly confined to the duodenal descending portion.
   - There is no described continuity between these findings, and they occur in non-adjacent anatomical regions.

   This level of documentation meets standard protocol requirements for describing the spatial distribution of findings.

3. Standardized Documentation:
   Q: Is pattern classification properly recorded?
   A: Based on the analysis, the appropriate pattern classifications are:
   - Erosions in gastric antrum: "scattered" distribution
   - Ulcers in duodenal descending portion: "scattered" distribution

   This classification follows standard protocol and accurately reflects the description in the endoscopic report.

   Q: Are all required elements present?
   A: The required elements for standardized documentation are:
   - Finding type (using standardized terminology): "erosion" and "ulcer"
   - Anatomical location(s) (using standardized terminology): "gastric_antrum" and "duodenal_descending"
   - Distribution pattern (using standardized classification): "scattered" for both

   All these elements are present and can be properly formatted according to the required JSON structure.

   Q: Does documentation meet guidelines?
   A: Yes, the documentation meets standard guidelines for endoscopic reporting. The findings are described with appropriate anatomical precision, standard terminology is used, and the distribution patterns can be accurately classified based on the information provided.

### Output:
{
    "patterns": [
        {
            "finding_type": "erosion",
            "locations": ["gastric_antrum"],
            "distribution": "scattered"
        },
        {
            "finding_type": "ulcer",

            "distribution": "scattered"
        }
    ]
}

## Example 2:
Gender: Male
Age: 73
Endoscopic Findings: Ileocecal valve: normal. Terminal ileum: normal. Ascending colon: 0.8cm sub-pedunculated polyp, EMR performed, defect clipped. Transverse colon: two 0.6-0.7cm sub-pedunculated polyps, EMR performed, defects clipped. Descending colon: 1.5Ã—1.0cm irregular mass at 36cm, friable, thrombin spray applied. Sigmoid: multiple 0.3-0.5cm polyps removed by forceps. Rectum: normal with internal hemorrhoids.

### Reasoning:
1. Standard Pattern Assessment:
   Q: Following protocol, how should distribution be evaluated?
   A: According to standard colonoscopy documentation protocols, the distribution of lesions should be evaluated by:
   1. Identifying the anatomical location(s) where each type of finding is present
   2. Determining whether lesions are single or multiple within each location
   3. Assessing whether lesions span across adjacent anatomical regions or are scattered across non-adjacent regions
   4. Categorizing the distribution pattern according to standardized definitions

   In this case, I must evaluate the distribution of polyps found in the ascending colon, transverse colon, and sigmoid colon, as well as the mass in the descending colon.

   Q: What pattern classifications are recognized?
   A: The standard pattern classifications in colonoscopy documentation are:
   - Continuous: Findings span adjacent anatomical locations without interruption
   - Scattered: Multiple discrete findings distributed across non-adjacent locations
   - Localized: Single location involvement with one or more findings
   - Diffuse: Widespread involvement across multiple locations

   Q: How should extent be documented?
   A: The extent should be documented by specifying:
   1. The precise anatomical location(s) using standardized terminology
   2. The distribution pattern for each finding type
   3. Size measurements where available
   4. The number of lesions when specified

2. Protocol-Based Analysis:
   Q: Does the distribution match defined patterns?
   A: Analyzing each finding type:
   - Polyps: Found in three non-adjacent segments of the colon (ascending_colon, transverse_colon, and sigmoid_colon). This matches the definition of a "scattered" distribution pattern.
   - Mass: Found only in the descending colon. This is a single lesion in a single location, matching the definition of a "localized" distribution pattern.

   The polyps are not continuous across adjacent segments (the descending colon separates the transverse colon from the sigmoid colon, and has a different type of lesion). The mass is limited to a single segment.

   Q: Is the extent properly quantified?
   A: The extent is well quantified in the report:
   - Ascending colon: One 0.8cm polyp
   - Transverse colon: Two 0.6-0.7cm polyps
   - Descending colon: One 1.5Ã—1.0cm mass
   - Sigmoid colon: Multiple 0.3-0.5cm polyps (exact number not specified)

   All findings have size measurements, and except for the sigmoid polyps, the exact number is specified. This level of quantification meets standard documentation requirements.

   Q: Are relationships documented per protocol?
   A: The spatial relationships are appropriately documented:
   - Each finding is precisely localized to specific colonic segments.
   - There is no suggestion of continuous involvement across segments.
   - The distribution of polyps across non-adjacent segments is clearly documented.

   This level of documentation meets standard protocol requirements for describing the spatial distribution of findings.

3. Standardized Documentation:
   Q: Is pattern classification properly recorded?
   A: Based on the analysis, the appropriate pattern classifications are:
   - Polyps across ascending, transverse, and sigmoid colon: "scattered" distribution
   - Mass in descending colon: "localized" distribution

   This classification follows standard protocol and accurately reflects the description in the colonoscopy report.

   Q: Are all required elements present?
   A: The required elements for standardized documentation are:
   - Finding type (using standardized terminology): "polyp" and "mass"
   - Anatomical location(s) (using standardized terminology): "ascending_colon", "transverse_colon", "sigmoid_colon" for polyps; "descending_colon" for mass
   - Distribution pattern (using standardized classification): "scattered" for polyps, "localized" for mass

   All these elements are present and can be properly formatted according to the required JSON structure.

   Q: Does documentation meet guidelines?
   A: Yes, the documentation meets standard guidelines for colonoscopy reporting. The findings are described with appropriate anatomical precision, standard terminology is used, and the distribution patterns can be accurately classified based on the information provided.

    "patterns": [
        {
            "finding_type": "polyp",
            "locations": ["ascending_colon", "transverse_colon", "sigmoid_colon"],
            "distribution": "scattered"
        },
        {
            "finding_type": "mass",
            "locations": ["descending_colon"],
