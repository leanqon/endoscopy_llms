## Example 1:
Gender: Male
Age: 74
Endoscopic Findings: Esophagus: No abnormalities. Cardia: Z-line clear, normal position, mucosa normal color and smooth. Fundus: Smooth mucosa, clear mucus, small amount. Body: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly red. Angle: Normal morphology, smooth mucosa, curvature present. Antrum: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly white, scattered punctate and patchy erosions in antrum. Pylorus: Round, opens and closes well. Duodenum: Bulb shows mucosal congestion, descending portion shows multiple shallow ulcers covered with yellow-black coating.

### Reasoning:
1. Finding Inventory:
   Q: What types of findings are present?
   A: The report describes two types of findings: erosions in the antrum and ulcers in the duodenal descending portion.

   Q: Where are these findings located?
   A: The erosions are located in the gastric_antrum. The ulcers are located in the duodenal_descending.

2. Distribution Analysis:
   Q: How are findings spread across locations?
   A: The erosions are described as "scattered punctate and patchy" in the antrum, indicating they are distributed throughout this region but limited to it. The ulcers are described as "multiple" in the duodenal descending portion, suggesting several ulcers within this single location.

   Q: Do findings span multiple locations?
   A: No, each type of finding is confined to a specific location. The erosions are only in the gastric antrum, and the ulcers are only in the duodenal descending portion.

3. Pattern Classification:
   Q: What distribution pattern best describes these findings?
   A: For the erosions in the gastric antrum, they are described as "scattered" within this single location, which matches the "scattered" distribution pattern. For the ulcers in the duodenal descending portion, they are described as "multiple" within this single location, which also indicates a "scattered" pattern.

   Q: Does the pattern match standard definitions?
   A: Yes, "scattered" is defined as multiple discrete findings distributed across a location, which matches both the erosions in the antrum and the ulcers in the duodenal descending portion.

### Output:
{
    "patterns": [
        {
            "finding_type": "erosion",
            "locations": ["gastric_antrum"],
            "distribution": "scattered"
        },
        {
            "finding_type": "ulcer",

        }
    ]
}

## Example 2:
Gender: Male
Age: 73
Endoscopic Findings: Ileocecal valve: normal. Terminal ileum: normal. Ascending colon: 0.8cm sub-pedunculated polyp, EMR performed, defect clipped. Transverse colon: two 0.6-0.7cm sub-pedunculated polyps, EMR performed, defects clipped. Descending colon: 1.5Ã—1.0cm irregular mass at 36cm, friable, thrombin spray applied. Sigmoid: multiple 0.3-0.5cm polyps removed by forceps. Rectum: normal with internal hemorrhoids.

### Reasoning:
1. Finding Inventory:
   Q: What types of findings are present?
   A: The report describes two types of findings: polyps and a mass. Polyps are found in the ascending colon, transverse colon, and sigmoid colon. A mass is found in the descending colon.

   Q: Where are these findings located?
   A: The polyps are located in ascending_colon, transverse_colon, and sigmoid_colon. The mass is located in descending_colon.

2. Distribution Analysis:
   Q: How are findings spread across locations?
   A: The polyps are distributed across three non-adjacent segments of the colon (ascending, transverse, and sigmoid). The mass is isolated to a single location (descending colon).

   Q: Do findings span multiple locations?
   A: The polyps span multiple non-adjacent locations, indicating a scattered distribution. The mass is limited to a single location, indicating a localized distribution.

3. Pattern Classification:
   Q: What distribution pattern best describes these findings?
   A: For the polyps found in ascending, transverse, and sigmoid colon, the distribution pattern is "scattered" as they appear in multiple non-adjacent locations. For the mass in the descending colon, the distribution pattern is "localized" as it appears in only one location.

   Q: Does the pattern match standard definitions?
   A: Yes, "scattered" is defined as multiple discrete findings distributed across non-adjacent locations, which matches the polyps. "Localized" is defined as single location involvement, which matches the mass in the descending colon.

## Example 3:
Gender: Male
Age: 34
Endoscopic Findings: Esophagus: two varices beyond 30cm with red signs, sclerotherapy performed (6ml polidocanol). Stomach: mosaic pattern, antral erosions, 0.3cm ulcer. Duodenum: 0.5cm hyperplastic polyp in descending part.

### Reasoning:
1. Finding Inventory:
   Q: What types of findings are present?
   A: The report describes four types of findings: varices in the esophagus (best categorized as "mass"), erosions in the antrum, an ulcer in the antrum, and a polyp in the duodenal descending portion.

   Q: Where are these findings located?
   A: The varices are located in esophagus_middle (based on 30cm distance). The erosions and ulcer are in gastric_antrum. The polyp is in duodenal_descending.

2. Distribution Analysis:
   Q: How are findings spread across locations?
   A: The varices are described as "two" in the esophagus, indicating multiple discrete findings in one location. The erosions in the gastric antrum are implied to be multiple. The ulcer is a single finding in the gastric antrum. The polyp is a single finding in the duodenal descending portion.

   Q: Do findings span multiple locations?
   A: No, each type of finding is confined to specific locations. The varices are only in the esophagus middle. The erosions and ulcer are in the gastric antrum. The polyp is only in the duodenal descending portion.

3. Pattern Classification:
   Q: What distribution pattern best describes these findings?
   A: For the varices in the esophagus middle, the pattern is "scattered" as there are multiple discrete findings in one location. For the erosions in the gastric antrum, the pattern is "scattered" as implied by typical antral erosions. For the ulcer in the gastric antrum, the pattern is "localized" as it's a single lesion. For the polyp in the duodenal descending portion, the pattern is "localized" as it's a single lesion.

   Q: Does the pattern match standard definitions?
   A: Yes, "scattered" is defined as multiple discrete findings within a location, and "localized" is defined as single location involvement with one finding.

## Example 4:
Gender: Female
Age: 63
Endoscopic Findings: Esophagus: No abnormalities. Cardia: Z-line clear, normal position, mucosa normal color and smooth. Fundus: Smooth mucosa, clear mucus, small amount. Body: Seven flat polyps seen, size ranging from 0.2cm-0.6cm, larger ones removed by snare electrocautery, smaller ones partially removed by biopsy forceps and electrocautery ablation. Angle: Normal morphology, smooth mucosa, curvature present. Antrum: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly red, one shallow ulcer approximately 0.2cm, surface covered with thin white coating, surrounding mucosa congested and edematous, scattered punctate and patchy erosions also seen. Pylorus: Round, opens and closes well. Duodenum: No abnormalities in bulb and descending portion.

### Reasoning:
1. Finding Inventory:
   Q: What types of findings are present?
   A: The report describes three types of findings: polyps in the gastric body, an ulcer in the gastric antrum, and erosions in the gastric antrum.

   Q: Where are these findings located?
   A: The polyps are located in gastric_body. The ulcer and erosions are located in gastric_antrum.

2. Distribution Analysis:
   Q: How are findings spread across locations?
   A: The polyps are described as "seven flat polyps" in the gastric body, indicating multiple discrete findings within this location. The ulcer is described as "one shallow ulcer" in the gastric antrum, indicating a single finding. The erosions are described as "scattered punctate and patchy" in the gastric antrum, indicating multiple discrete findings.

   Q: Do findings span multiple locations?
   A: No, each type of finding is confined to specific locations. The polyps are only in the gastric body. The ulcer and erosions are in the gastric antrum.

3. Pattern Classification:
   Q: What distribution pattern best describes these findings?
   A: For the polyps in the gastric body, the pattern is "scattered" as there are multiple discrete findings in one location. For the ulcer in the gastric antrum, the pattern is "localized" as it's a single lesion. For the erosions in the gastric antrum, the pattern is "scattered" as there are multiple discrete findings.

   Q: Does the pattern match standard definitions?
   A: Yes, "scattered" is defined as multiple discrete findings within a location, and "localized" is defined as single location involvement with one finding.

## Example 5:
Gender: Female
Age: 48
Endoscopic Findings: Esophagus: Scattered patchy mucosal defects >5mm in lower portion, non-confluent. Cardia: Clear Z-line, normal position with smooth mucosa. Gastric fundus: Smooth mucosa with clear minimal mucus. Gastric body: 4mm flat polyp on upper greater curvature, smooth surface, removed by biopsy forceps. Gastric angle: Normal morphology with smooth mucosa and preserved curvature. Gastric antrum: Red and white mottled mucosa, predominantly red, with scattered patchy erosions. Pylorus: Round with good function. Duodenum: Unremarkable bulb and descending portion.

### Reasoning:
1. Finding Inventory:
   Q: What types of findings are present?
   A: The report describes three types of findings: mucosal defects in the lower esophagus, a polyp in the gastric body, and erosions in the gastric antrum.

   Q: Where are these findings located?
   A: The mucosal defects are located in esophagus_lower. The polyp is located in gastric_body. The erosions are located in gastric_antrum.

2. Distribution Analysis:
   Q: How are findings spread across locations?
   A: The mucosal defects are described as "scattered patchy" and "non-confluent" in the lower esophagus, indicating multiple discrete findings. The polyp is described as a single "4mm flat polyp" in the gastric body. The erosions are described as "scattered patchy" in the gastric antrum, indicating multiple discrete findings.

   Q: Do findings span multiple locations?
   A: No, each type of finding is confined to specific locations. The mucosal defects are only in the lower esophagus. The polyp is only in the gastric body. The erosions are only in the gastric antrum.

3. Pattern Classification:
   Q: What distribution pattern best describes these findings?
   A: For the mucosal defects in the lower esophagus, the pattern is "scattered" as there are multiple discrete findings described as non-confluent. For the polyp in the gastric body, the pattern is "localized" as it's a single lesion. For the erosions in the gastric antrum, the pattern is "scattered" as they are described as scattered patchy.

   Q: Does the pattern match standard definitions?
   A: Yes, "scattered" is defined as multiple discrete findings within a location, and "localized" is defined as single location involvement with one finding.
