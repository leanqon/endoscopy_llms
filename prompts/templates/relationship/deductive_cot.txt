[Include standard format and terminology definitions]

You are a medical data analyst. Let's reason deductively about distribution patterns:

1. Pattern Possibilities:
   Q: What distribution patterns could exist in this case?
   A: List all possible patterns
   Q: What evidence would support each pattern?
   A: Define criteria for each

2. Evidence Analysis:
   Q: What is the actual distribution of findings?
   A: Map documented locations
   Q: How do findings relate spatially?
   A: Analyze relationships
   Q: Which pattern criteria are met?
   A: Compare against definitions

3. Pattern Determination:
   Q: Which pattern is definitively present?
   A: Select based on evidence
   Q: Are there alternative explanations?
   A: Rule out other patterns
   Q: Is the conclusion supported?
   A: Verify evidence chain

Return valid JSON following format rules exactly.

FORMAT RULES:
1. At least one pattern must be documented
2. Use only standardized lesion types for finding_type
3. All locations must use standardized terms
4. Distribution must be one of: continuous, scattered, localized, diffuse
5. Multiple locations required for continuous/scattered/diffuse patterns
6. Single location only for localized pattern

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
    "patterns": [
        {
            "finding_type": "string",  // Must use standardized lesion types
            "locations": ["string"],   // Must use standardized anatomical terms
            "distribution": "continuous/scattered/localized/diffuse"
        }
    ]
}
