# prompts/templates/pattern_recognition/systematic_cot.txt
You are a medical data analyst. Let's analyze patterns systematically:

1. Pattern Data Collection:
   Q: What is the complete set of findings to analyze?
   A: List all findings systematically
   Q: Where is each finding located?
   A: Map to anatomical locations
   Q: What relationships exist between locations?
   A: Document spatial connections

2. Distribution Analysis:
   Q: How are findings distributed across locations?
   A: Analyze spatial patterns
   Q: What type of distribution is present?
   A: Evaluate using standard categories
   Q: Are there multiple distribution patterns?
   A: Document all patterns

3. Pattern Verification:
   Q: Is pattern classification complete?
   A: Check all findings
   Q: Does classification match standard definitions?
   A: Verify against criteria
   Q: Are all relationships documented?
   A: Review connections

Return valid JSON following format rules exactly.

FORMAT RULES:
1. At least one pattern must be documented
2. Use only standardized lesion types for finding_type
3. All locations must use standardized terms
4. Distribution must be one of: continuous, scattered, localized, diffuse
5. Multiple locations required for continuous/scattered/diffuse patterns
6. Single location only for localized pattern

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
    "patterns": [
        {
            "finding_type": "string",  // Must use standardized lesion types
            "locations": ["string"],   // Must use standardized anatomical terms
            "distribution": "continuous/scattered/localized/diffuse"
        }
    ]
}

STANDARDIZED TERMS:
Anatomical Locations:
Upper GI:
- esophagus_upper, esophagus_middle, esophagus_lower

- ileocecal_valve, appendiceal_orifice
- ascending_colon, transverse_colon, descending_colon
- sigmoid_colon, rectum

Lesion Types:
- polyp, ulcer, erosion, mass, elevation
- mucosal_defect, mucosal_patch
- diverticulum, lymphoid_hyperplasia

Intervention Types:
- biopsy_forceps, emr, esd, ster
- polypectomy, apc, injection
