[Include standard format and terminology definitions]

You are a medical data annotator. Identify distribution patterns of findings across locations. Follow format rules exactly and use only standardized terms.

Return valid JSON following format rules exactly.

FORMAT RULES:
1. At least one pattern must be documented
2. Use only standardized lesion types for finding_type
3. All locations must use standardized terms
4. Distribution must be one of: continuous, scattered, localized, diffuse
5. Multiple locations required for continuous/scattered/diffuse patterns
6. Single location only for localized pattern

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
    "patterns": [
        {
            "finding_type": "string",  // Must use standardized lesion types
            "locations": ["string"],   // Must use standardized anatomical terms
            "distribution": "continuous/scattered/localized/diffuse"
        }
    ]
}

STANDARDIZED TERMS:
Anatomical Locations:
Upper GI:
- esophagus_upper, esophagus_middle, esophagus_lower
- gastric_cardia, gastric_fundus, gastric_body, gastric_angle, gastric_antrum, gastric_pylorus
- duodenal_bulb, duodenal_descending

Lower GI:
- terminal_ileum
- ileocecal_valve, appendiceal_orifice
- ascending_colon, transverse_colon, descending_colon
- sigmoid_colon, rectum

Lesion Types:
- polyp, ulcer, erosion, mass, elevation
- mucosal_defect, mucosal_patch
- diverticulum, lymphoid_hyperplasia

Intervention Types:
- biopsy_forceps, emr, esd, ster
- polypectomy, apc, injection
- clipping, hemostasis
- submucosal_dissection

Here is two examples of pattern recognition:

Example 1:
Gender: Male
Age: 74
Endoscopic Findings: Esophagus: No abnormalities. Cardia: Z-line clear, normal position, mucosa normal color and smooth. Fundus: Smooth mucosa, clear mucus, small amount. Body: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly red. Angle: Normal morphology, smooth mucosa, curvature present. Antrum: Mucosa mottled red and white predominantly white, scattered punctate and patchy erosions in antrum. Pylorus: Round, opens and closes well. Duodenum: Bulb shows mucosal congestion, descending portion shows multiple shallow ulcers covered with yellow-black coating.
Endoscopic Diagnosis: Duodenal bulbitis, multiple descending duodenal ulcers, chronic non-atrophic gastritis with erosions.

Output:
{
    "patterns": [
        {
            "finding_type": "erosion",
            "locations": ["gastric_antrum"],
            "distribution": "scattered"
        },
        {
            "finding_type": "ulcer",
            "locations": ["duodenal_descending"],
            "distribution": "scattered"
        }
    ]
}

Example 2:
Gender: Male
Age: 73
Endoscopic Findings: Ileocecal valve: normal. Terminal ileum: normal. Ascending colon: 0.8cm sub-pedunculated polyp, EMR performed, defect clipped. Transverse colon: two 0.6-0.7cm sub-pedunculated polyps, EMR performed, defects clipped. Descending colon: 1.5Ã—1.0cm irregular mass at 36cm, friable, thrombin spray applied. Sigmoid: multiple 0.3-0.5cm polyps removed by forceps. Rectum: normal with internal hemorrhoids. Insertion time: 7min, withdrawal time: 15min. Boston Bowel Prep Score: 5.
Endoscopic Diagnosis: Descending colon mass - nature undetermined, hemostasis performed; multiple colonic polyps (EMR and forceps removal), internal hemorrhoids, poor bowel prep, recommend early repeat examination.

Output:
{
    "patterns": [
        {
            "finding_type": "polyp",
            "locations": ["ascending_colon", "transverse_colon", "sigmoid_colon"],
            "distribution": "scattered"
        },
        {
            "finding_type": "mass",
            "locations": ["descending_colon"],
            "distribution": "localized"
        }
    ]
}
