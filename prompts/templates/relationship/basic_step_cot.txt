[Include standard format and terminology definitions]

You are a medical data annotator. Let's analyze distribution patterns:

1. Finding Inventory:
   Q: What types of findings are present?
   A: List all findings using standard terms
   Q: Where are these findings located?
   A: Map to anatomical locations

2. Distribution Analysis:
   Q: How are findings spread across locations?
   A: Examine spatial relationships
   Q: Do findings span multiple locations?
   A: Note connections between areas

3. Pattern Classification:
   Q: What distribution pattern best describes these findings?
   A: Choose from: continuous/scattered/localized/diffuse
   Q: Does the pattern match standard definitions?
   A: Verify against criteria

Return valid JSON following format rules exactly.

FORMAT RULES:
1. At least one pattern must be documented
2. Use only standardized lesion types for finding_type
3. All locations must use standardized terms
4. Distribution must be one of: continuous, scattered, localized, diffuse
5. Multiple locations required for continuous/scattered/diffuse patterns
6. Single location only for localized pattern

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
    "patterns": [
        {
            "finding_type": "string",  // Must use standardized lesion types
            "locations": ["string"],   // Must use standardized anatomical terms
            "distribution": "continuous/scattered/localized/diffuse"
        }
    ]
}
