RELATIONSHIP TASK - PATTERN IDENTIFICATION

Purpose: Identify how findings are distributed across different locations.

FORMAT RULES:
1. At least one pattern must be documented
2. Use only standardized lesion types for finding_type
3. All locations must use standardized terms
4. Distribution must be one of: continuous, scattered, localized, diffuse
5. Multiple locations required for continuous/scattered/diffuse patterns
6. Single location only for localized pattern

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
    "patterns": [
        {
            "finding_type": "string",  // Must use standardized lesion types
            "locations": ["string"],   // Must use standardized anatomical terms
            "distribution": "continuous/scattered/localized/diffuse"
        }
    ]
}
